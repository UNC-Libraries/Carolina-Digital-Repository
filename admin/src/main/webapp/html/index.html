				<h1><i>Carolina Digital Repository</i></h1>
<p>The Carolina Digital Repository (CDR) is an initiative that preserves and provides Internet access to at-risk digital content produced at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. At-risk content includes materials and research which would lost to future researchers if not collected and preserved.

The University Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill sponsors the CDR, and the materials come primarily from its faculty and students. UNC is committed to the long-term availability of these collections and their online records. An steering committee guides development of this research resource.

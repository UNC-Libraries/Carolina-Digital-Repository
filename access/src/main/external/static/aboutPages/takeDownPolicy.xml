		There exists the possibility that complaints arise regarding alleged
		copyright or
		licensing infringement violations pertaining to material included in the
		Carolina
		Digital Repository (CDR), or material that is deemed to be potentially
		libelous,
		plagiarized, or legally offensive. In the event that such a complaint is made, it
		will
		be referred to the Repository Librarian with one working day of receipt.
		The
		Repository Librarian will be responsible for assessing, within a second working
		day, what risks may be incurred by leaving the offending materials
		accessible or
		visible. If such risk seems likely, the Repository Librarian will take action
		to
		make the digital object inaccessible, although some metadata relating to
		the
		material may remain searchable and viewable.</p>
	<p>
		The Repository Librarian should inform the depositor of the material that
		a
		complaint has been lodged. The Librarian may also seek the advice of University
		Counsel in determining the ultimate resolution of the complaint. A
		record of the
		complaint and its resolution should be recorded with the metadata for the
		collection of which the object or objects are a part and associated
		with the
		submission agreement under which the material was acquired.

               <mods:abstract>According to literary critic Juan Antonio Masoliver Ródenas, Spanish novels written at
      the end of the twentieth century reflected Spanish society's dissatisfaction with its
      government and general pessimism. The purpose of this dissertation is to study five Spanish
      novels written at that time--Martín Casariego's El chico que imitaba a Roberto Carlos (1996),
      Lorenzo Silva's Algún día, cuando pueda llevarte a Varsovia (1997), Ray Loriga's Héroes
      (1993), José Ángel Mañas' Mensaka (1995), and Care Santos' Okupada (1997)--to show that while
      some authors indeed provided a dark and negative vision of Spanish society, others gave the
      reader a more optimistic and positive image of the nation and its future. The texts chosen for
      this study all present the world from the perspective of Spanish adolescents and focus on the
      many different issues they must confront in an increasingly globalized society. In order to
      understand the context from which these novels originated, they are analyzed from an urban and
      cultural perspective. This approach also helps to establish a parallel between a young
      person’s coming-of-age and the social, political and cultural changes taking place in Spain at
      the turn the twenty-first century. Given the importance of the development of identity in
      these texts, the correlation between the Spanish adolescent novel and the tradition of the
      Bildungsroman is also explored. A key to the process of identity development is the different
      mechanisms young people rely on to escape (albeit temporarily) from their problems. Some of
      the alternatives available to adolescents presented in the texts studied here are the use of
      the imagination, the development of an ecological consciousness, and participation in social
      youth movements, such as painting graffiti and squatter movements. In the end, the choices
      made by Casariego, Silva, Loriga, Mañas, and Santos’ protagonists reveal the essential
      differences among the Spanish novels written in the 1990s. By presenting the reader with an
      image of youth that is hedonistic and materialistic, Héroes and Mensaka confirm the critics’
      assertion that the Spanish novel reflected the nation’s disenchantment and pessimism. However,
      the level of social engagement that motivates the actions of the protagonists of El chico ,
      Algún día, and Okupada suggests that not all Spanish novelists viewed their nation from the
      same negative perspective. What is more, the optimistic futures suggested in these three
      novels positively influence young Spanish readers at a time in their lives when they are
      developing their own identity as individuals and social beings. By presenting characters that
      face their problems and explore the various options available to them, these authors
      indirectly help their adolescent readers who are themselves living similar situations and in
      the process of becoming adults.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The primary purpose of this study was to determine the most valuable benefits of
      donation to current Rams Club donors. The secondary purpose of this study was to provide a
      demographic profile of Rams Club donors. On line surveys were distributed to 8,789 members of
      the Rams Club. Completed surveys were collected from 703 members. Results indicated that Rams
      Club membership was heavily dominated by Caucasian males with 63.1% falling between the age of
      35 and 64. A majority of members responded that they earned between $50,000 and $149,000
      annually. The five most frequently chosen benefits of donation were 1) priority seating at
      football games, 2) priority seating at men's basketball games 2) parking at football games 4)
      parking at men's basketball games, 4) priority points. Significant relationships were found
      between one benefit of donation and giving level as well as between giving level and age,
      gender and race/ethnicity.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The work presented in this thesis corresponds to the use of infrared lasers to probe
      the rotational, vibrational, and solvation dynamics of molecules and molecular clusters
      embedded in liquid helium droplets. The formation of clusters of hydrogen fluoride (HFn, n _
      3) provides a compelling example of the unique cluster growth process that occurs when single
      HF molecules are sequentially added to a helium droplet. From the infrared spectrum in the H-F
      stretching region, it is apparent that the cold, liquid helium environment quenches the
      condensation energy so rapidly that the fifth HF molecule is kinetically trapped behind the
      small barrier to insertion into the cold, preformed tetramer ring. The energy available to the
      metastable "4+1" cluster is insufficient to surmount the barrier to the
      lower energy cyclic pentamer. The isomerization dynamics of solvated molecular complexes are
      studied with infraredinfrared double resonance spectroscopy, consisting of two infrared lasers
      used in a pumpprobe configuration. Binary systems with two minima on their potential surfaces
      are chosen such that the vibrationally excited state energy is larger than both the
      isomerization barrier and the dissociation energy. One of two possible isomers is
      vibrationally excited. After the absorption of the first infrared photon, the cold helium heat
      bath removes the excited vibrational energy on a time scale that is fast in comparison to the
      droplet flight time between the upstream pump and downstream probe laser interaction iv
      regions. The probe laser is tuned through the vibrational bands of the two isomers, and a
      negative (positive) signal in the double resonance spectrum corresponds to a reduction
      (increase) in the population of the probed isomer. We observe photo-induced isomerization of
      the binary HCN-HF, HF-N2O, and HCN-HCCH complexes, while the two isomers of HCN-HCCCN do not
      isomerize. The results are rationalized in terms of the ab initio intermolecular potentials.
      When photo-induced isomerization is observed, the downstream population ratios are observed to
      be strongly dependent on the identity of the upstream isomer and the excited vibrational mode.
      These observations provide strong clues regarding the mechanisms of the vibrational relaxation
      processes occurring for molecular complexes solvated in liquid helium droplets.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Consumers frequently make decisions about when to consume a product and what costs to
      incur to obtain sooner consumption. Prior research has demonstrated that consumers show
      decreasing levels of impatience as the length of delay for consumption gets longer (i.e.,
      present-biased preferences or hyperbolic discounting). In this dissertation, I explore the
      roots of decreasing consumer impatience and identify factors that lead to differential
      sensitivity to time horizon. In two essays, I show that the concreteness of mental
      representation and of processing are two possible mechanisms behind present-biased
      preferences. I hypothesize that present-biased preferences are observed when mental
      representations and processing are concrete, and that this effect is attenuated when consumers
      think more abstractly. In essay 1, I examine the role of representational concreteness by
      making use of two temporal frames (delay and expedite) that differ in their associated degree
      of concreteness. I show that (1) defer and expedite frames are associated with different
      patterns of discounting, (2) the two frames are associated with differential levels of outcome
      concreteness, and (3) this variation in outcome concreteness can explain the difference in
      present bias. In essay 2, I explore the role of processing concreteness (e.g., focusing on the
      big picture or on the details) in consumers' present bias. I hypothesize and show that
      consumers who think more concretely will be more prone to hyperbolic-like discounting compared
      to those who think abstractly - even when processing concreteness is manipulated using an
      unrelated task. Taken together, this dissertation provides a better understanding of the
      psychological mechanisms driving intertemporal preferences in general and present-biased
      preferences in specific. I examine the cognitive underpinnings of present-biased preferences
      and use temporal framing (Essay 1) and prior decisions (Essay 2) to establish concreteness of
      outcomes and processing as potential sources of decreasing impatience. The results reported in
      this dissertation extend the current theorization in intertemporal choice, temporal framing,
      mental construal, and sequential decisions. These findings suggest that conceptualizing
      concreteness at multiple levels helps explain not only hyperbolic discounting, but also adds
      to the understanding of several related consumer behavior phenomena.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study is an approach to some narrative texts from Central American in the 20th
      Century. It centers around the evaluation of the impact that the discourse of certain authors
      has made in the socio-political context of their nations, in a crucial moment of their recent
      history. Authors such as Arturo Ambrogi (El Salvador, 1875-1936), Sergio Ramírez (Nicaragua,
      1942- ) and Ana Guadalupe Martínez (El Salvador, 1952 - ) employ strategies to control the
      literary discourse in an attempt to help shape the national dialogue on identity. The texts
      written by these Central American writers have been manipulated by elements external to the
      book (such as editors, editions, political forces) in order to serve contemporary interests.
      My own observations on these literary documents revolve around those aspects that reflect a
      position of authority. Through those aspects one can analyze the attempts to manipulate the
      discussion on national identity towards a single and restrictive perspective. I intend to
      point to the conflictive relationship between text and the community it represents; I do this
      by focusing my attention on the ostentatious position of enunciation that the subject of each
      narrative adopts. Finally, I show how the nexus between literary subject and the voices it
      incorporates into the narrative, as well as the connection between text and national context
      is a communication link that undergoes constant reformulation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In Black Culture and Black Consciousness, historian Lawrence W. Levine emphasizes the
      role of religion in the cultural aspects of black identity formation. Through an examination
      of six selected black churches in the Atlanta area, this study explores the attitudes of
      church leaders and their congregants toward maintaining records to preserve institutional
      memory, as well as for legal and administrative reasons. The study examines the impact of

      and black theology. Also discussed is the role that archives have on the preservation of
      institutional memory by expounding upon the notion of accountability and custody, their
      importance to the continued existence of these cultural religious institutions, and how they
      can greatly benefit the community as well as contribute to the historical literature in

               <mods:abstract>In this dissertation I discuss the ways in which socially conscious playwrights in
      early-twentieth century Argentina used and adapted theatre genres to advance women's rights
      and project the feminist imagination. I also analyze how theatre critics and spectators
      reacted to these early feminist spectacles. In Chapter 1, I provide an overview of the
      repression of women that was dictated by the Argentine Civil Code and the efforts of feminist
      activists to make reforms. I also describe how various playwrights (Salvadora Medina Onrubia,
      José González Castillo, César Iglesias Paz, Alfonsina Storni, and Malena Sándor) used the
      genre of thesis drama to support social and legislative progress from 1914 to 1937. I explain,
      in Chapter 2, how marginalized female playwrights (Lola Pita Martínez, Alcira Olivé, Carolina
      Alió, Salvadora Medina Onrubia and Alfonsina Storni) cultivated the unique strategy of
      "feminist melodrama," which allowed them to endorse feminism from within an
      accepted "feminine" genre. Conventional comedy used strategically--by female
      playwright Malena Sándor and the male collaborators Camilo Darthés and Carlos Damel--to
      criticize the treatment of women in the 1930s and 40s is the subject of Chapter 3. I conclude
      my study, in Chapter 4, with an analysis of mythbased works (by Alfonsina Storni, Conrado Nalé
      Roxlo, Malena Sándor and Josefina Marpóns) that debunk patriarchal legends through radical
      dramatic techniques from 1931 to 1950.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>RNA interference (RNAi) is a recently discovered phenomenon in which double-stranded
      RNA (dsRNA) silences endogenous gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. RNAi shares a
      remarkable degree of similarity with silencing phenomena in other organisms, suggesting that
      RNAi is part of an ancient and conserved pathway used to regulate gene expression, to
      eliminate defective RNAs and to defend against viral infections and transposons. RNAi has also
      been implicated in developmental processes, suggesting that RNAi may play a broader role in
      regulating normal gene expression. Since its discovery, the use of RNAi has become widely
      employed in many organisms to specifically knock down gene function. Although we have learned
      much about the general mechanisms underlying RNAi, a detailed understanding of how RNAi works
      remains to be elucidated. I have developed a candidate screen approach in which I use RNAi to
      identify genes required for RNAi. I identified a number of potential candidates and in a
      secondary screen, using mutant animals, validated roles for several new genes in RNAi.
      Interestingly, many of these genes encode protein known to function in the nucleus, and some
      of the genes identified are members of the well characterized SynMuv B pathway. In addition, I
      have further characterized the role of a nuclear RNA helicase, These results suggest clues and
      iii provide important tools toward furthering our emerging understanding of nuclear mechanisms
      of RNAi interference in animals.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Similar to the positive illusion people demonstrate for themselves, people also have
      exaggeratedly positive views of their relationship. This perceived superiority encompasses the
      belief that one's relationship has more good features and fewer bad features than other
      people's relationships, and it plays a functional role in reducing doubt and sustaining
      conviction in relationships. This dissertation tests the role of accessibility experiences in
      influencing perceived superiority in close relationships. People can make judgments on the
      basis of two distinct factors: (a) accessible content (what information is brought to mind);
      and (b) accessibility experience (how easily information is brought to mind). Prior research
      on perceived superiority has focused only on the accessible content dimension, while
      completely neglecting the possibly critical influence of people's accessibility experiences.
      Three studies were designed to test the role of accessibility experience in perceived
      superiority. Study 1 (n = 154) provided evidence that people find listing positive or negative
      thoughts about their own or others' relationships differently easy or difficult. Study 2 (n =
      118) further examined this issue by returning to the method of prior research by manipulating,
      within-subjects, the relationship target and valence variables. Study 3 (n = 198) provided
      evidence that directly manipulating accessibility experience through a thoughts-listing task
      affects a variety of relationship variables.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Force is fundamental to all biological systems, from the molecular level in cells to
      the complex organism. These forces are generated by the cytoskeleton alone or in conjunction
      with motor proteins, by utilizing ATP and GTP as fuels. This study investigates novel
      techniques to manipulate cytoskeletal systems to understand these forces, and, investigate the
      effect of physiologically relevant forces on these systems. Dielectrophoresis, the movement of
      polarizable particles in an electric field gradient was used to pattern the deposition of
      actin filaments, and, organize the random movement of actin filaments on myosin V motor
      protein to a collimated movement. Microfluidic channels were then used independent of the
      above to apply flow induced force and torque to actin filaments during motility. These
      experiments showed that forces significantly lower than motor forces can generate torques on
      the filaments and steer them during motility. Further, torque due to flow on actin filaments
      was shown to be capable of polarizing randomly aligned filaments during motility. Finally, we
      investigate a new approach of using rod shaped particles as microrheological probes. Viscosity
      of Newtonian fluids measured with nano rods were in good agreement with expected viscosity
      values and hence validate this approach. In complex iv solutions, the measured values deviated
      from expected values leading us to conclude that there is a shape and size dependant
      interaction between the mesh network of complex fluids and rod shaped particles. This has
      implications to how the cytoplasm, a complex fluid, affects cytoskeletal and organelle
      organization, restricts DNA mobility during gene delivery and motility of rod shaped pathogen
      within cells.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Despite the broad range of attempts to mix "rock" and
      "classical" music by "progressive ("prog")
      rock" musicians from the late 1960s, many writers on prog rock have interpreted the
      music in a relatively monolithic manner; they often have interpreted the resulting
      intertextuality simplistically as an elitist experiment that opposes rock's populist origin.
      This could certainly be one interpretation of prog, but it is only one of many; there are
      additional kinds of possible narratives, according to the specific ways in which the materials
      are combined and fused. Yet the variety of intertextual approaches has rarely been recognized
      explicitly, and little analytical or musicological attention has been paid to the distinctly
      different intertextual styles. Generalized approaches to intertextuality have been common not
      only within popular music studies, however, but also within many humanistic fields. Since
      Julia Kristeva's coinage of the term intertextuality in the late 1960s, theorists of the arts
      (literature, music, painting, architecture, etc.), sociology, politics, economics, and many
      other fields, have almost always treated intertextuality in a singular manner, presuming that
      all intertextual practices are more or less of the same kind. Consequently, dynamic aspects of
      intertextuality that result from correlation between diverse forms of intertextuality have
      rarely been fully considered, though they play crucial roles in the history of iii
      twentieth-century arts. This dissertation suggests the need to view intertextuality in its
      multiplicity and dynamism, by disclosing and interpreting a variety of intertextual practices
      and their important historical developments in the case of prog-rock keyboardist Keith
      Emerson's "crossover" music. Six new models of intertextuality are
      introduced and explored in detail as Emerson's important intertextual styles. These models are
      termed: background intertextuality, dialectic intertextuality, revisionary intertextuality,
      subtle intertextuality, multi-ply intertextuality, and framed intertextuality. These are
      distinct from the Bakhtinian "dialogic" model of intertextuality, but play
      crucial roles in the stylistic development of the musician. This study thus proposes and
      models a range of pragmatic ways to expand the scope of intertextual analysis, and transcend
      the limits of certain intertextuality theories in music, as well as in the arts in general.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study seeks to enhance understanding of successful new product innovation by
      developing and testing a new theory framework for explaining the market orientation-product
      innovation relationship in the context of firms' new product development (NPD) processes.
      Drawing on and adapting key concepts from organizational learning theory, and particularly in
      the area of capability-rigidity theory, the study investigates how market orientation may
      create rigidity, known as competency traps, that reduce innovation performance. Competency
      traps concern the propensity of a firm to continue relying on processes that have been
      successful in the past even though they are no longer optimal. Although the concept of
      competency traps was introduced in management literature more than a decade ago, it has been
      the focus of little conceptual development and no empirical research. Given the potential
      adverse consequences of competency traps in NPD, it is important that we understand the
      sources and impact of competency traps. This study develops an integrated conceptual framework
      to help researchers and managers identify and reduce the effect of competency traps on NPD.
      The development of a valid measure of competency traps should enable researchers and managers
      to better diagnose competency traps. Entrepreneurial orientation and network learning are
      suggested as the remedy to manage the possible adverse effects. The study includes a major
      survey of the responses of 113 marketing managers from a high-technology industrial zone in
      China. Structural equation modeling and reliability tests are used for data analysis. Three
      types of competency traps are identified: (1) vision traps, (2) technology traps, and (3)
      routinization traps. The newly developed scales demonstrate reasonably good validity and
      reliability. The findings show that customer orientation leads to a routinization trap.
      However, routinization traps are positively associated with NPD creativity and NPD efficiency.
      Vision traps are negatively associated with NPD creativity. The relationship between
      technology traps and new product innovation is indirect and moderated by entrepreneurial
      orientation and network learning. Entrepreneurial orientation but not network learning is the
      remedy for highly market-oriented firms to reduce technology traps. The implications,
      limitations, and future research directions are also discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Large, urban institutions are well represented in American public library history, but
      the stories of libraries in small towns or in rural areas are not as well represented. During
      the twentieth century, local citizens in six small Moore County, North Carolina towns
      ("small" here defined as towns having less than five thousand residents)
      established and maintained local public libraries. Some of the libraries failed over time,
      some succeeded, but all of them went through a process of finding their place in their
      community and governmental environments, environments that were themselves changing with the
      times. Using newspaper articles, augmented with interviews and direct observation, this is a
      study of those libraries and the people who created them - in the context of their times and
      circumstances, and in the context of how they were and are viewed by the profession of
      librarianship.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Questionnaires are sometimes administered to the same sample of examinees on more than
      one occasion. Even when longitudinal data are available, researchers employing item response
      theory (IRT) often use data only from the first administration for item calibration because
      there is likely a lack of conditional independence between responses to the same item from the
      same individual. However, in many longitudinal study designs, the sample size at one occasion
      is too small for reliable item calibration. Thus, a longitudinal IRT model for use with
      repeated measures study designs is desirable. This research develops two distinct approaches
      to longitudinal IRT. One of these models is based on latent class analysis, while the other is
      based on full-information bi-factor analysis. Both account for the local dependence among
      items that are administered twice by introducing parameters that describe how the repeated
      nature of each item affects the response (separately from the effect of the latent trait). The
      models include parameters that describe the latent trait distribution at the second
      administration relative to the standardized distribution at time one and the correlation
      between the latent traits at two time points. The addition of these model components allows
      item parameters to be calibrated using available data from two occasions.</mods:abstract>

      analysis of both internal and external characteristics affecting the ruling, it is concluded

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation revises the critical understanding of masque in the early modern
      period. While past scholarship has evaluated individual texts against the limiting formula of
      the "Jonsonian masque," I situate Jonson as but one of many writers working
      successfully in the genre. Moreover, although Stephen Orgel and others have provided
      invaluable insight into the political contexts of masque, I expand and supplement these
      arguments by considering the extensive social and artistic complexity of the form for its
      diverse range of writers, patrons, and audiences. As I demonstrate, the concept of variety is
      the constituent factor in the flexibility and diversity of masque during the seventeenth
      century. Finally, my dissertation introduces to masque studies several manuscripts-including
      Add. 10311, Enchiridion Christiados, and Royal 18 A LXXX, The Theater of Apollo-that I
      discovered in the British Library. By introducing the concept of aesthetic variety articulated
      by a majority of seventeenth-century masque writers, chapter one lays the foundation for
      re-evaluating the inherent complexity of masque. The second chapter explores the history and
      etymology of "masque" to postulate that, in the sixteenth century, masquing
      was inseparable from other forms of military display; it then traces the intersections of
      masque's martial iconography and English foreign policy in both early Stuart courts. Chapter
      three examines the increasing emphasis on pseudo-liturgical display in masque during the early
      seventeenth century, culminating in the masque's establishment as the secularized liturgy of
      state by the Caroline period. The final chapter further demonstrates the multifariousness of
      the genre by probing the multiple, often contradictory, reactions of country masque writers to
      the secularized, "popish" liturgy of the Caroline court masque - for
      instance, the strict adherence to The Book of Common Prayer lectionary calendar that grounds
      Enchiridion Christiados. In short, this dissertation foregrounds variety as the central
      element of both the masque's formal diversity and its socio-political potential to advise,
      critique, and defend as well as simply entertain. The masque is transposed from the domain of
      Ben Jonson, Inigo Jones, and the court to a genre of broad influence and importance to early
      modern culture as a whole.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of professional development
      programs for English as a Second Language (ESL) teachers on their classroom practice, and how
      teacher efficacy and organizational support at the school level relate to this process by
      interacting with years of teaching experience. The Modified Teacher Efficacy Scale, the
      Organizational Support Scale, and the Impact Scale were used to collect selfreported data on
      teacher efficacy, organizational support, and the impact of professional development,
      respectively. The Teacher Background Questionnaire was used to collect demographic data as
      well as information on years of teaching experience. The population of this study comprised of
      232 participants from the Carolina Academic Consortium (CAC) and 68 participants from
      Consortium for South and North Carolina (CSNC). These two identical professional development
      programs provided funding for currently licensed teachers from both North and South Carolina
      that led to add-on ESL licensure. Among the 232 CAC participants, 145 met the criterion to
      participate in this study. Among the 68 CSNC participants, 29 were qualified for the present
      study. Of those who were invited to participate in the study, 90 CAC and 24 CSNC participants
      responded. iv Multiple regression analyses were used to explore the effects of teacher
      efficacy and organizational support on predicting the impact of professional development. With
      the use of a p &lt; 0.05 criterion, the two independent variables (i.e., teacher efficacy
      and organizational support) both reached statistical significance in predicting the impact of
      professional development. The results from these analyses attest to the tenets of the social
      cognitive theory. Teachers with strong efficacy beliefs reported to having implemented more of
      what they had acquired from professional development. Furthermore, organizational support
      predicted the level of impact above and beyond teacher efficacy. These two major variables
      evidenced their effects even after controlling for years of teaching experience and did not
      interact with the latter teacher characteristic.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis examines possible biblical subtexts for the image of the reed in Osip
      Mandelstam's poem "Notre Dame." By exploring how the different metaphorical
      functions of the image of the reed in the Russian Bible can influence the reading of this
      image in Mandelstam's poem, the thesis draws connections with the image of the reed and the
      themes of Egyptian might and the meekness of Christianity earlier in the poem. The thesis also
      addresses how such an interpretation of the image of the reed could enhance other critical
      readings of the poem, especially those that see the poem as an expression of Acmeism.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, representations of
      Quakers-like the Quaker Oats man-were perennially popular, on oatmeal canisters and throughout
      popular culture. In this dissertation, I examine popular representations of Quakers-in jokes,
      popular magazines, novels, images, advertising and other media-from 1850 to 1920. I also
      consider, where possible, Friends' reactions to these depictions. During this period, popular
      representations of Friends typically evidence a longing for the devout distinctiveness Friends
      were imagined to possess-evidenced by their plain dress, plain speech, and well-known
      restrictions against dishonesty and oath-swearing. The traditional and visible testimonies of
      Friends were quickly changing during the latter half of the nineteenth century. This evolution
      seemed to quicken the broader population's desire to retain and refashion a plain-dressed,
      old-fashioned representative of a national purity, piety, and unity that never existed. The
      most striking features of Quakers depicted in nineteenth century literatures and images center
      around the following categories: plain speech, abolitionism and women's rights, pacifism and
      war, plain dress (in the form of the Quaker bonnet), and the (in)famous Quaker Oats man. In
      the first body chapter, I explore the Quaker distinctive of plain speech, which seemed to
      acquire new and greater significance throughout the broader culture just as iv Friends were
      abandoning the witness. Rinsed of doctrinal significance, this testimony became an attractive
      and admirable anachronism, signifying an imagined set of old-fashioned values. In the third
      and fourth chapters, I explore the ways in which the Quaker witnesses for reforms and pacifism
      were absorbed and transformed by purveyors of popular culture who occasionally valued these
      testimonies but often reshaped them to suit opposing purposes. In the fifth and sixth
      chapters, I explore the ways in which dress and appearance-for Quaker women and the Quaker

               <mods:abstract>This study will trace the sociolinguistic fortune of the culinary terms from Apicius'
      De re coquinaria into the major medieval romance dialects. As the only cookbook from
      antiquity, the culinary context of De re coquinaria offers a social context in which we may
      observe sociolinguistic change and variation from Latin to the major medieval romance
      dialects. We may observe dialectal phonological and morphological change and variation of the
      culinary terms, their sociolinguistic stratification based on socially determined variables
      including class, internal and foreign linguistic borrowing based on prestige and culinary
      innovation, and diachronic dialectal semantic change. This study will demonstrate ultimately
      linguistic conservatism or innovation of the culinary terms in the major medieval romance
      dialects.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Previous studies indicate gender differences in both Internet usage and general
      philanthropic giving. Through a survey of alumni at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
      Hill, this study seeks to identify how gender differences are reflected when the Internet and
      philanthropy are combined. Gender differences in philanthropy on the Internet are examined
      from a public relations perspective, focusing on the importance of relationships and
      incorporating relevant public relations theories. Findings from this study suggest that there
      are no significant differences between men and women in their attitudes toward the Internet as
      a fund-raising and relationship-building tool. The results do indicate, however, that e-mail
      and the Internet are quickly becoming important communication channels in development and fund
      raising. Implications for development officers and fund raisers are discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Singular control is an important and challenging class of problems in stochastic
      control theory. Such control problems can rarely be solved explicitly and thus numerical
      approximation schemes are necessary. In this work we develop approximation schemes for
      singular control problems with state constraints. The first problem we consider arises in
      problems of optimal consumption and in- vestment under transaction costs. We use Markov chain
      approximations to develop a convergent numerical scheme. Proof of convergence uses techniques
      from the theory of weak convergence. Specific features that make the analysis nontrivial
      include unboundedness of state and control spaces and cost function; degeneracies in the
      dynamics; and presence of both singular and absolutely continuous controls. We present a
      computational algorithm and the results of a numerical study. Numerical schemes for singular
      control problems can be computationally quite intensive, and thus it is of great interest to
      develop less expensive schemes that exploit specific features of the underlying dynamics. To
      this end we investigate connections between singular control and optimal stopping problems. A
      key technical step in establishing such connections is proving existence of an optimal
      singular control. We prove such a result for a general class of singular control problems with
      linear dynamics and state constrained to be in a polyhedral cone. A particular example of this
      class of models are the so-called Brownian control problems (BCPs) and thus existence of
      optimal controls for BCPs follows as a consequence. Armed with this existence result, we
      consider a two-dimensional singular control problem that arises from queueing networks. We
      prove rigorously an equivalence of this iii problem with an optimal stopping problem. We
      exploit this connection in developing simple computational schemes for the singular control
      problem, and we investigate performance of the schemes in a numerical study.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation examines the effects of global powers upon the local communities of
      Guatemala at three points in the twentieth century as they are portrayed by Miguel Ángel
      Asturias, Otto René Castillo and Luis de Lión. Each author denounces his historical moment and
      each one offers a solution to the problems they present. The primary theorists used to guide
      this study are Mikhail Bakhtin, Roland Barthes, Edward Said and Raymond Williams. The
      introductory chapter serves two purposes. First, it offers a concise overview of the study as
      a whole. Second, it clarifies theoretical terminology that is used throughout the
      dissertation. The second chapter, "Spatial Disparities in Miguel Ángel Asturias's
      Viento fuerte," examines the devastation wrought within Guatemala by the U.S.-based
      United Fruit Company. This chapter studies the degree to which cultural identity is threatened
      in the face of economic imperialism. "Creating a Space for Love and Revolution: The
      Poetry of Otto René Castillo" is the title of the third chapter. This section reads
      the militant poet's work as a call to action. His conversationalist poetry is approached as a
      protest against the capitalist world in which he lived; his love poetry is interpreted as an
      articulation of the Socialist Revolution that Castillo posed as a solution to the problems
      triggered by the capitalist system. The fourth and final chapter, "Spatializing
      Ladinoization: Luis de Lión's El tiempo principia en Xibalbá," reads de Lión's novel
      as a rejection of the colonial process of ladinoization that he saw as leading to the demise
      of his Mayan culture. This chapter shows that essential to the novelist's argument is his
      criticism of the role the Mayan themselves play in ladinoization and, by extension, the decay
      of their cultural heritage. Finally, this dissertation draws the conclusion that even though
      each author is distinguished by his historical moment and political agendas, all three are
      united in their belief in the power of community to change the course of history.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation argues that contemporary Irish authors use the horror genre to
      critique postcolonial nation-states' pretensions to coherent national identities. The horror
      genre, with its interest in hybrid identities and constructions of monstrosity, allows a
      unique consideration of possible futures for recently postcolonial societies. I begin by
      situating contemporary authors like Patrick McCabe and Martin McDonagh historically, through
      comparisons to writers like J.M. Synge and Sean O'Casey who included on-stage violence to
      undercut an emerging stereotype of the Irish "national character" as
      dependent on certain religious (Catholic), political (nationalist), and geographic (rural)
      affiliations. This "Gaelic Romantic" stereotype remains powerful today, and
      contemporary authors use horrific material for reasons remarkably similar to their Irish
      Literary Renaissance counterparts: as part of a demythologizing project. The first chapter
      defines the horror genre and argues that it often is explicitly concerned with constructions
      of national identity, mainly due to its constructions of monstrosity as that which lies beyond
      the pale of an accepted "national character." My second chapter, shows that
      characters associated with a Gaelic Romantic construction of Irish national identity meet with
      a grisly, horror-film-style end when they are, quite literally, killed off. The third chapter
      argues that these contemporary authors believe such stereotypes of national identity should be
      bloodily dispatched not only because they are iv repressive and false, but also because the
      articulation of an ideal of what the nation is requires the simultaneous articulation of what
      it is not. The construction of national identity necessitates the abjection of those groups
      perceived as a threat to that nation, and those groups become a society's monsters.
      Contemporary Irish authors are both fascinated by this process and critical of it. They
      ultimately suggest that abjection cannot provide sufficient ground for a coherent individual
      or national identity. The final chapter argues that the monstrous emerges in these works as a
      site of possibility, and that the authors suggest that today's abjected identities must become
      tomorrow's full citizens of the state for a better Ireland to emerge. The necessary hybridity
      and fusion inherent in the monstrous provides a blueprint for conceptualizing more fluid, less
      atavistic identities.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Images of Haiti have circulated in the social imagination of the United States through
      painting, sculpture, illustration, performance and film since the late eighteenth century.
      Although much scholarship addresses the intertwined and often problematic relationship between
      the United States and Haiti, sparse art historical research addresses the complexities of U.S.
      visualizations of Haiti. The period of the U.S. occupation of Haiti (1915-1934) and its
      immediate aftermath resulted in the opening up of Haiti to unprecedented numbers of writers,
      ethnographers, and artists who focused both on Haiti as a contemporary nation, and retold and
      reinterpreted its revolutionary history to express new social and political needs. This
      dissertation contributes to a greater understanding of how representations of Haiti
      overwhelmingly articulate issues of race, while also touching on cultural anxieties of class,
      religion, patriotism and national identity. This dissertation specifically examines how
      African-American artists have worked against mainstream representations of Haiti to create
      alternate visions, combating and complicating many stereotypes, while also furthering an
      understanding of the transnational influences and outlook of several prominent
      twentiethcentury African-American artists. Aaron Douglas, Jacob Lawrence, and William E. Scott
      are just a few of the African-American artists who drew on Haiti as a source of racial pride
      and heritage, personal transformation, or as a signifier for revolutionary change. iv While
      rooted in art historical analysis, privileging the visual over the text, this is an
      interdisciplinary dissertation that focuses on the broader context of cultural studies. I draw
      on both popular media and the performing and fine arts, and match art historical traditions
      with histories of anthropology and its evolving ethnographic practices, and the politics of
      U.S. international relations in the Caribbean. Through this lens, I expose how creative
      representations by African-American artists attempted to open new spaces in interpretations of
      Haiti, escaping the litany of tired and derogatory tropes so frequently applied to the
      "Black Republic."</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Mental retardation and autism spectrum disorders do not yet command the same critical
      attention as sensory or mobility impairments. Rosemary Garland Thomson's Extraordinary Bodies
      (1997) set a precedent from which few have deviated, deftly including intellectual disability
      in a taxonomy for disability studies without exploring the subject in depth. My project
      addresses such continued oversight by turning to the pivotal nineteenth century, a period when
      promising medical innovation was outpaced by increasingly isolationist institutional practices
      and dehumanizing, proto-eugenicist systems of thought. A few writers moved against this
      powerful current, interrogating their own prejudices as they created progressive visions of
      the intellectually disabled in close, interdependent communion with an able-minded majority.
      The project opens with an examination of how individuals with cognitive disabilities provided
      the people of an increasingly powerful nation with a useful yardstick against which to measure
      their industrial and social progress. It then considers Mary Shelley's deconstructions of
      monstrosity within the context of a pervasive physiognomic practice. Charles Dickens's
      increasingly non-stereotypic portrayals of the idiot, the Brontë sisters' visions of domestic
      care for the mentally disabled and mentally ill in a time of growing iv institutionalization,
      and Robert Browning's critique of proto-eugenicist and intellectist ideology, as well as his
      refined use of terms like "idiot" and "imbecile."</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study examined the extent to which fourteen experienced social studies teachers
      pursued critical inquiry in the teacher research process. The social studies teachers in this
      study were all former members of the social studies cohort in the Masters of Education (M.Ed.)
      program at a large research university. During the M.Ed. program the teachers took a course on
      teacher research in which they conducted their own teacher research projects. Using a case
      study method, data was collected from documentary evidence [including final teacher research
      reports, course documents, and other supporting documents] and one-on-one interviews with the
      teacher researchers and the instructor of the Teacher as Researcher course. Postmodernism
      served as the theoretical framework for presenting the findings of this study. Whereas the
      literature on teacher research presents two distinct forms of teacher research - practical and
      critical, the research conducted by members of the social studies cohort spread out along a
      continuum of critical inquiry. For organizational purposes the fourteen teachers where grouped
      as: practical teacher research that resulted in little classroom change, practical teacher iv
      research that resulted in classroom change, critical teacher research that resulted in
      classroom change, and critical teacher research that resulted in classroom and school change.
      This study describes the multiple and varied iterations of critical inquiry pursued by social
      studies teachers in the teacher research process. These findings are significant in forming a
      new theoretical understanding of teacher research and determining ways for social studies
      teacher educators and policy makers to support the work of teacher researchers.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>What David Lewis proved in 1976 was stronger than he realized. Not only can no system
      of logic can have a conditional connective with non-trivial conditional probability, but also
      no probability space can have even a single non-trivial conditional event. However, Lewis'
      definition of conditional connective is flawed, and does not apply to his original target, the
      Stalnaker/Thomasson C2 logic. Lewis assumed a property which Stalnaker's system does not have
      - McGee's export-import law. Modal models of Stalnaker's C2 exist for every first-order model.
      Stalnaker's corner connectives, when interpreted as Lycan-style quantified conditionals, do
      have nontrivial conditional probability. Interpreting propositions as indicator functions
      instead of sets of possible worlds, the modern Kolmogorov theory of conditional expectation
      opens new possibilities for simultaneously modeling both objective and subjective probability
      as the expectation of truth. I use the new interpretation to defend Lycan's theory of
      conditionals against an objection from Dorothy Edgington.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation addresses the issue of race in regard to the Mexican immigrant in
      both Latino and Mexican theater and performance. The introduction, Chapter 1, defines race as
      biological differentiations that are reiterated through historical understandings in both
      Mexico and the United States. In the United States, the history of race is based on colonial
      encounters and issues of slavery, among other factors. In Mexico, racial concepts were
      influenced by a process of cultural mestizaje that tended to incorporate indigenous elements
      into the modernizing project of Mexico, and resulted in a movement toward the whitening of the
      race. Chapter 2 discusses role playing in regard to the construction of racial identities in
      Milcha Sánchez-Scott's Latina and Víctor Hugo Rascón Banda's La mujer que cayó del cielo. I
      question racial categorization in terms of globalization and transnational markets in Coco
      Fusco and Nao Bustamante's Stuff and Luis Valdez's Los vendidos in Chapter 3. The concept of
      'nation' and national identity for Mexican immigrants, and how their racialized bodies
      challenge conceptualizations of an essentialist nation-popular is explored in Hugo Salcedo's
      El viaje de los cantores and Cherríe Moraga's Watsonville: Some Place not Here in Chapter 4.
      The characters in each play of this study must confront their biological differences and learn
      to classify their Latino identity in order to confront the binary black and white racial
      standards of the United States as well as the process of mestizaje in Mexico. In order to
      negotiate a definition of the term race that is not based on bipolarities, the concept of a
      posthegemonic race is introduced. This term proposes an ideology of race based on performances
      that challenge an historical duality of hegemonic and counterhegemonic racial identities that
      are determined primarily by skin color. This study concludes that posthegemonic races are
      classified according to individual performances and, as such, skin color is no longer the
      primary determining factor in racial classifications. In the Conclusion, Chapter 5, the issue
      of choice is reiterated as a challenge to immigrants that remains to be questioned in regard
      to race in both Mexico and the United States.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The present study was an ethnographic study of forty-two families who had children
      with known or suspected genetic disorders. These families were part of a larger study that
      investigated culture and family interpretations of genetic disorders. The purpose of the
      current study was to focus on the social support networks utilized by these families, the
      families' perceptions of their child with a disability, and whether these constructs vary by
      ethnicity and income levels. A qualitative approach was employed to investigate these major
      research questions with interview data analyzed through the use of thematic analysis. The
      results indicated that social support from both informal and formal networks was significant
      in the lives of families of children with disabilities. Parents generally viewed their formal
      and informal networks as supportive and vital to the daily care of their child with
      disabilities. Ethnicity was not found to be a marked source of variation in families'
      perceptions of social support. An interpretation of this finding is that families who have a
      child with a disability come to share common experiences with other parents of children with
      disabilities. With regard to family perceptions of the child with a disability, the results
      indicated that medical views of disability, religious beliefs, views of normalcy, labeling,
      stigma and discrimination were factors influencing how families viewed their child with a
      disability. These factors influenced parental beliefs regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and
      prognosis of their child's condition. By using qualitative methodology the results extend what
      is currently known and contribute to a better understanding of the context and meanings
      associated with family perceptions of social support and their child with a disability. This
      information may facilitate better relationships between families and healthcare providers, and
      contribute to the development of programs and interventions to better serve them and their
      children with disabilities.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this thesis is to bring more attention to "family
      caregivers," or those who provide unpaid assistance to sick or aging relatives, often
      to the detriment of their own physical and mental health. More than 30 million family, or
      "informal," caregivers are responsible for the care of elderly spouses,
      siblings and parents - many of whom have Alzheimer's disease or another dementing illness -
      and the size of this caregiving population is about to increase as life expectancy increases
      and baby boomers age. This thesis assesses the literature and media coverage published
      heretofore on the subject of informal caregiving in America, and, through a seri es of five
      family profiles and an article on a local respite program, adds to the growing body of
      literature on this significant national issue.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Objective: To compare the acute effects of a dynamic warm up and standard warm up on
      hamstring, quadriceps, and hip flexor flexibility, quadriceps and hamstring strength, and
      vertical jump height and power. Design and Setting: An experimental research design was used
      to compare a standard warm up (n=15), a dynamic warm up (n=15), and a control group (n=15) on
      acute changes after a single bout of warm up. Subjects: Forty-five physically active
      recreational soccer players (age = 22.13 ± 2.77 years, ht = 68.47 ± 3.77 in, wt = 73.59 ±
      14.53 kg) volunteered to participate. Measurements: Flexibility, strength, vertical jump
      height, and vertical jump power were evaluated. A mixed model analysis of variance was used
      for statistical analyses. Results: The dynamic warm up significantly increased hamstring
      flexibility from pre test measures (p &lt; 0.0001) and significantly increased eccentric
      quadriceps peak torque (p = 0.012). Furthermore, a trend indicated that the dynamic warm up
      increased concentric quadriceps peak torque from pre to post-test measures. No other variables
      were significantly impacted by any warm up group. Conclusion: Our results suggest that an
      acute bout of a dynamic warm up improves hamstring flexibility and eccentric quadriceps
      strength. Future research should investigate the effects of a dynamic warm up on reducing

               <mods:abstract>This essay analyzes how two religious organizations in post-Soviet Russia, the
      Jehovah's Witnesses and the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC), grappled with the legacy of the
      Soviet past in light of Russia's emerging democracy. Unlike other post-authoritarian states,
      the Russian government did little to address state repression, instead leaving society to sort
      out the victims from the collaborators and perpetrators. Witness and Orthodox versions of
      Soviet religious repression emerged in this climate of fractured narratives. The Witnesses
      made their Soviet-era repression into a rallying point for their international movement, and
      within Russia, into a platform for demanding equal rights. The ROC responded by contesting
      both the Witnesses' depiction of Soviet repression and their right to practice in Russia. The
      Witnesses exposed a major fault line in Russia's transition to democracy. The battle for
      control over religion's Soviet legacy demonstrates the malleability and instability of
      Russia's relationship to its Soviet past.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis examines the Columbia University protest of April 1968 through the lens of
      space. It concludes that the student communes established in occupied campus buildings were
      free spaces that facilitated the protestors' reconciliation of political and social
      difference, and introduced Columbia students to the practical possibilities of democratic
      participation and student autonomy. This thesis begins by analyzing the roots of the disparate
      organizations and issues involved in the protest, including SDS, SAS, and the Columbia School
      of Architecture. Next it argues that the practice of participatory democracy and maintenance
      of student autonomy within the political counterculture of the communes awakened new political
      sensibilities among Columbia students. Finally, this thesis illustrates the simultaneous
      growth and factionalization of the protest community following the police raid on the communes
      and argues that these developments support the overall claim that the free space of the
      communes was of fundamental importance to the protest.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis examines the mobilization apparatus of Nashi, a pro-Putin Russian youth
      social movement organization, from its formation in March 2005 to the present. The work
      explains how the organization orients itself within the socio-political field of contemporary
      Russia and how these orientations allow it to mobilize youths towards the achievement of its
      goals, namely, the support of the political modernization program of Russian President
      Vladimir Putin and the training of the next generation of the Russian
      "elite." Three components of Nashi's mobilization are analyzed: the
      formation of an effective collective identity and ideology; orientations to other actors
      within the socio-political field, with special emphasis placed on its relationship to the
      administration of Vladimir Putin; and interactions with the Russian media</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Through qualitative in-depth interviews, healthcare industry executives explain that
      corporate giving is based on the mission and culture of an organization, benefiting employee
      and community relations and enhancing the core business. While difficult to tie to the bottom
      line, corporate giving can help establish partnerships and relationships that benefit the
      commercial interests of the corporation. This multi-step series of actions is organized in
      this study using the corporate giving process model. Of the executives interviewed in this
      study, all agreed that their companies' giving is becoming more strategic over time. As
      companies begin to realize the potential of corporate giving to fulfill business goals,
      patterns of giving are becoming more strategically focused. Emerging from this study is the
      industry-partnerimpact model of corporate giving that the author contends is worthy of further
      investigation in healthcare and other industries.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study investigated the relationship between composite bat technology and 13
      offensive statistics. In addition to bat technology it analyzed the relationship between ball
      Coefficient of Restitution and offensive statistics. The study included 28 NCAA Division I
      Louisville Slugger Sponsored programs from the 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 seasons. All teams
      were using the same Louisville Composite bat in the 2005 season; the 'Catalyst' and all had
      the same choices of Louisville bats to choose from in 2002, 2003, and 2004. The ball has been
      changed from a COR of .50 to a .47. The results indicated that there was no effect for the
      change in COR, but that there was an effect for change in bat technology. Of the seven
      statistical categories utilized in the one-way ANOVA, five of them returned a significant
      result and two did not. The results further indicated that the change in bat is significant in
      producing more home runs, higher slugging percentages, and better batting averages. The
      descriptive statistics indicated a dramatic increase in mean home runs and mean hits, with a
      45% increase in mean homeruns in 2005.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In the eyes of Nazi Germany, the ethnic Germans or die Volksdeutschen-people of German
      ancestry who lived beyond the prewar borders of the German state-inhabited an ambiguous racial
      territory. Because the SS alone controlled the ethnic German settlements in the Transnistria,
      a region that encompasses much of present-day Moldova and western Ukraine, it was able to
      enact radical policies that constricted the decision-making space in which ethnic Germans
      chose to become Holocaust perpetrators. In contrast to their endangered position under Soviet
      rule, those ethnic Germans who supported the Transnistria's new Nazi order received material
      rewards from their SS overlords. But those ethnic Germans whom the SS found politically and
      racially objectionable felt the regime's unrestrained brutality. Using both German and Soviet
      sources, this thesis examines the relationship between this exceptional context and the crimes
      of the Transnistria's ethnic German auxiliary police during the winter of 1941-42.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Acute static stretching has been shown to decrease strength, power, and endurance. The
      effects of acute PNF stretching have not been investigated. Additionally, a population with
      tight musculature may respond differently to stretching than those who have a normal muscle
      length. This study investigated how PNF stretching affected anterior pelvic tilt, hip
      extension range of motion (ROM), hip extensor strength, agility, and vertical jump height in
      those with and without tight hip flexors. Tight subjects had reduced ROM when compared to not
      tight subjects. There was a significant increase in ROM after stretching in both tight and not
      tight subjects. Following stretching, both tight and not tight subjects experienced a
      significant reduction in anterior pelvic tilt. There were no significant differences between
      groups or tests in vertical jump height or strength variables. PNF stretching increases
      stretch tolerance, but does not appear to influence antagonist muscle strength.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In the early 1990s conflict broke out in several former Soviet republics as different
      regions vied for independence. Abkhazia in Georgia and Transdniestria in Moldova were two such
      regions. The Russian government initially declared neutrality in both cases but soon changed
      course, instead supporting Abkhaz and Transdniestrian separatists. Several months later, the
      Russian government changed course and announced the installment of Russian peacekeeping troops
      in Georgia and Moldova. The intent of these peacekeeping missions was ostensibly to support
      the cessation of armed fighting and promote resolution of the disputes, but Russia's
      involvement in both cases was never as neutral or conflictresolution based as peacekeeping
      missions should be. This thesis will look at Russia's rationale for intervening in the
      Abkhaz/Georgia and Transdniestrian/Moldovan conflicts in order to better understand Russia's
      justification for getting involved.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This essay explores rhetorical transformations in Mumia Abu-Jamal.s Live from Death
      Row that function to expose and contest social inequalities. Pentadic analysis is used to
      explicate the transformation of scene into agency and illuminate justice as both a motive term
      and a cultural myth. The essay extends Burke.s argument that the establishment of a scapegoat
      represents one form of mystification, and examines how the dialectic of the scapegoat
      functions to demystify justice. By shifting justice from an ultimate term into the dialectic,
      Mumia challenges rhetorics of dehumanization that are (re)produced in discursive and ritual
      practices of legal, judicial, and penal institutions and transforms understandings of death
      penalty politics and practice.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>A series of disubstituted functionalized dienes have been synthesized and
      polymerizations have been attempted. Functional groups that were incorporated into the
      monomers included primary amine, tertiary amine, piperidyl and methoxy groups. Among these,
      the dimethylamine functionalized butadienes were of the most interest and proved to have the
      greatest potential to be polymerized. Both free radical and anionic polymerizations have been
      investigated. The effect of various initiators, types of the solvent, temperature, size of the
      side groups and chain transfer reactions on free radical and anionic polymerizations was
      studied in detail. These polymers were evaluated for their potential as gene delivery vectors.
      Cytotoxicity, binding affinity and transfection efficiency properties were examined. A
      systematic study of the structure-property relationships revealed that cytotoxicity decreased
      as the side group of the polymers was altered. The binding affinity between the polymers and
      DNA also decreased as the size of the side group increased. Of the polymers studied,
      poly[2-(N,N-diethylaminomethyl)-1,3-butadiene], with lower cytotoxicity than poly(ethylene
      imine) and reasonable transfection efficiency at an N/P ratio of 2, is a promising, novel
      transfection vector.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis explores the significance of the modifications Engelbert Humperdinck and
      his librettist Adelheid Wette made to the Grimm's version of "Hansel and
      Gretel" in the opera Hänsel and Gretel. I first examine how the role of the children
      transforms from a largely inactive one to a more labor-intensive one as a comment on child
      labor. Second, I investigate how the dramatic change in the leadership, along with the change
      in the profession of the father, comment on an emancipatory role for women and criticize
      traditional patriarchal power. Finally, I analyze how the addition of pedagogical and
      religious themes converts the opera into a didactic tool. All these themes - child labor,
      gender and pedagogical function - ultimately create a discourse about how children deserve a
      childhood free of abuse and adult anxiety, a childhood that equally educates both genders, and
      a childhood that instills confidence and religious faith in the child.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The final moments of Das Lied von der Erde have consistently been regarded as one of
      the most enigmatic endings in the history of Western music. The lack of musical resolution of
      the last movement offers a view into eternity that strikes a potent blow to our rational
      conception of human experience. An understanding of Mahler's relationship to finde- siècle
      society and his interaction with previous expressions of musical endings, especially those of
      Beethoven's Ninth and Wagner's Tristan, helps to shed some light on the ending of Das Lied.
      Mahler expresses his Weltanschauung through the tension that emanates from Das Lied. The
      unsettling result of this tension however, is not resolution or triumph, but an eternal
      (ewig), never-ending dialectic struggle between the psyche and the exterior world.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study examines the relationship between ascribed characteristics such as
      socioeconomic status and race, family practices, and educational mobility. I analyze data from
      the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY79) to investigate the relationship between
      cultural and human capital, parent-child interaction styles, family togetherness, and the
      educational attainment of youth whose parents never attended college. Prior research suggests
      that family structure and certain key family practices are positively related to college
      attendance. I include a broader set of family practices to investigate whether they mitigate
      the relative influence of socioeconomic status and race on college attendance or whether they
      interact with socioeconomic status and race to produce differential effects. I show that
      family practices and socioeconomic status are related to college enrollment and selectivity of
      postsecondary institution. Additionally, I find that family context moderates the relative
      power of social and cultural capital in providing access to upward educational mobility.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The developments in technology and resulting uncertainty in the global media
      marketplace have put media companies in search of successful business models. This qualitative
      research studied Bertelsmann AG, one of the world's largest media conglomerates, and its
      realignment from an external-growth-oriented media company to a company concentrating on
      organic growth initiatives in core business areas. This research attempted to assess the
      company's outlook and to evaluate, whether Bertelsmann's repositioning could be seen as a
      model for success in a global economy. For this purpose, interviews with nine industry experts
      were conducted. The results show that Bertelsmann has a strong record in remaining profitable,
      but its conservative approach may pose a threat to its global top-tier position. But the
      findings also indicate that Bertelsmann's approach could be a key for success in a global
      economy. These findings can provide further studies a point of reference when evaluating the
      growth strategies of global media companies.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study explores why sex trafficking occurs in Europe; the nature of trafficking
      networks; and the efforts Germany, Poland, and Ukraine have made to stop trafficking within
      their borders. A supply chain model is used to explain how organized crime groups structure
      their networks, how the groups operate through the networks, and the success and profitability
      of trafficking. The geographic complexity of the networks contributes to the difficulties
      states have in disrupting the flow of women. Although many factors explain the ease of
      "recruitment" of women in Eastern Europe, trafficking remains a
      demand-driven market due to the desire of West European men for sexual services. In order for
      states to decrease trafficking, they must actively work to end the demand for prostitution.
      This can be accomplished by adopting an abolitionist law regarding prostitution, while also

               <mods:abstract>Hypermeter plays a remarkable role in the fugal development in the last movement of
      Beethoven's Sonata in A major, Opus 101. Although previous analyses rarely consider the
      presence of hypermeter in fugal textures, my research indicates that hypermeter is a critical
      component of this music's goal-directed nature. Using methodologies deriving from the work of
      Lerdahl and Jackendoff, Rothstein, and Schachter, I trace processes of hypermetric expansion
      throughout the fugue, and demonstrate how expanded hypermetric structures contrast dynamically
      with more prototypical structures. Additionally, I investigate localized metric conflicts in
      which two metric interpretations are simultaneously possible, using the groundwork laid out by
      Krebs, Schachter, and Samarotto. These instances further contribute to the teleological
      progression of the development toward its retransition. Throughout my analysis, I encompass my
      findings within the narrative metaphor of a metric "plot," lending greater
      weight to the role of meter as a developmental phenomenon.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis asks how the "sexual liberation movement," which emerged
      at the nexus of the sexual revolution, the New Left, and women's liberation, began, took
      shape, and affected students on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
      between 1969 and 1973. Although today many people associate the sixties and seventies with
      sexual anarchy, an analysis of this movement reveals that its leaders saw it as bringing order
      to young people's sexual lives. Galvanized by the lack of sexual information and products
      available to students during the 1960s, female and male faculty members and students came
      together in the early 1970s to develop discourses and services that taught an ethic of
      responsibility and promoted gender equality. In doing so, the movement's leaders at this
      southern university rose to national prominence, and their innovative programs became models
      for hundreds of other schools throughout America.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>While the importance of woody debris in rivers has been well-studied within the past
      few decades, the dynamics of the woody debris jam is often overlooked. This study focuses on
      the woody debris jam treating it as a complex and porous accumulation of heterogeneous
      material. Accounting for the momentum extracted as flow passes a debris jam, the drag force on
      three jams with differing structures, representing varying degrees of porosity, is quantified.
      Utilizing the drag force equation along with the volume and surface area of the jam, the
      effect of structure on hydraulics is investigated. A theoretical model for debris jam
      evolution is hypothesized based on these results and a review of the literature. The results
      from this study show that 1) natural debris jams are porous structures and 2) piece-size
      distributions may dictate the evolution of a debris jam and therefore its rate of change in
      hydraulics.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Dispositional accounts of morality seem a promising way to capture certain central
      features of morality. While Roderick Firth and Thomas Hill, Jr. each offer accounts of this
      sort, the result in each case is very different. In this paper, I will describe both views. I
      will criticize Firth for making reactions the central moral notion, and describe how that
      limits the extent to which his theory can explain moral motivation. I will show how Hill’s
      account can solve this problem, but argue that his view is problematic in requiring ideal
      legislators to be ignorant of their life situations, for this move limits the extent to which
      his theory can explain moral motivation. I will offer a suggestion that I think his account
      can easily accommodate, and briefly discuss how the resulting view is superior to Firth’s.</mods:abstract>

      Director across Divisions I, II and III and considering football sponsorship. For the purposes
      of this research, gender equity is defined as proportions of participation, operating budget,
      recruiting budget, scholarships budget, sport sponsorship, coaching salaries and full time
      coaching staff allotted to women's teams. One sample t-tests comparing the means for each
      gender of the Athletic Director in the eight components revealed that there were significant
      differences between the two groups in the Participation, Sport Sponsorship, and Coaching
      components of gender equity. 3 X 2 ANOVAs comparing means for the institutions that sponsor
      football with the means of those that do not in the eight components revealed that there were
      significant differences in the Participation and Operating Expenses variables.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Gettier counterexamples purport to show that justified true belief is insufficient for
      knowledge and, ipso facto, that true belief is insufficient for knowledge. I develop a
      strategy that the proponent of the true belief analysis of knowledge can deploy to explain
      away Gettier counterexamples, i.e., to show how the subject in them can merely appear to
      believe something truly without knowing it. I suggest that the proposition that appears to be
      truly, non-knowingly believed in a Gettier counterexample is actually not believed at all.
      Rather, the subject believes a closely related, false proposition. The subject cannot believe
      the true proposition, I propose, because of the special nature of certain of his or her
      concepts-what I call "representative concepts." The reason the subject
      appears to believe the true proposition is that we use a true sentence to ascribe the belief
      in the false proposition to him or her.</mods:abstract>

      European. Each accent pattern is distinguished by either alternating stress or vowel quality
      between "weak" forms (nominative, accusative, vocative) and
      "strong" forms. I argue that surface stress is the result of the interplay
      of the lexical accent specifications of the morphemes that compose the stem. The strong
      endings are classified as dominant and are thus responsible for the accent/ablaut
      alternations. Optimality Theory is used to provide a synchronic phonological analysis of
      athematic noun accent. The weak forms are accounted for with a ranking of faithfulness and
      alignment constraints, including a positional faithfulness ranking in which faithfulness to
      roots is preferred over faithfulness to derivational affixes. The strong endings, which are
      dominant, trigger antifaithfulness constraints (Alderete 1999), and so a new type of
      antifaithfulness constraint is introduced that works within inflectional paradigms, based on
      the Optimal Paradigms model (McCarthy 2005).</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The modern food production industry depends heavily on fossil fuels at all steps of
      the process to make food cheap, abundant and available. But prices for oil, natural gas and
      coal have been edging upward for the past few years. The continuous increase in energy prices
      has raised production costs across the industry, and businesses have begun to pass on the
      costs to the consumer. Some experts say that the food industry's reliance on cheap fossil
      fuels could eventually cripple the system. This series of articles examines the effect of
      higher energy prices on farming, processing, distribution, restaurants, retail and the
      purchasing decisions of consumers. It finds that individual farmers are the hardest hit so far
      and that it may be too early to say with certainly what will happen to the average consumer.
      Meanwhile, efforts are being made to lessen the reliance on fossil fuels by developing
      alternative energy sources</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The Ivy League is the only NCAA Division I conference that does not sponsor a
      basketball post season championship. Missed class time and increased expenses were cited as
      the main reasons why a tournament has not been held in the past. Student-athletes and coaches
      of all eight Ivy men's basketball teams completed surveys asking questions on whether they
      favored adding a conference tournament. Overall, 76% were in favor of a postseason tournament,
      and most believed the addition of a tournament would provide an opportunity for additional
      games (84%) and increased television exposure (82%), while not jeopardizing academic success
      (67%). Coaches and student-athletes selected having each tournament game played on individual
      campus sites as their most preferable tournament location (53%). A traditional eight-team
      bracket with no byes was their most favorable tournament format option (59%).</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis tracks changes in political thought in the writings of Niccolò Machiavelli
      and Francesco Vettori between 1512 and the 1520s. While modern historians have traditionally
      emphasized the early phase of their correspondence, I examine two often overlooked sources
      from later years: the letters they exchanged in the 1520s and Vettori's history, the Sommario
      della Istoria d'Italia. By the 1520s, the Italian political terrain had experienced sweeping
      and devastating transformations. I seek to explore the effects of those changes on these
      Florentines' thinking by highlighting an idea common to both of their writings-Italia. Through
      contrast with Vettori's thought, I contextualize the nature of Machiavelli's political
      observations after he had spent a decade and a half in political exile, while also shedding
      light on the dynamism of Italia in early sixteenth-century political discourse and
      historiography. In a short epilogue I suggest some ways in which a rethinking of early modern
      perceptions of Italia can also contribute to modern theoretical debates about the meaning of
      "nation."</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper explores the ways in which de Certeau's concepts of consumption and
      production inform rhetorical reception and invention. These notions are used to investigate
      the effects of the peacelines of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The peacelines are 50-foot tall
      concrete and barbed wire walls that separate Protestant and Catholic communities in Belfast. I
      argue that the peacelines are a representative place that provide grounds for the invention of
      rhetorical acts that develop and reinforce dialectically produced communal identities through
      stories of memory, ritual and territoriality.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this paper I argue that at least some of our concepts include phenomenal content.
      We could not understand the temperature talk of creatures that made non-inferential
      temperature ascriptions on the basis of a kind of temperature-vision rather than by touch. We
      could not understand them because we don't share the same sensations. If this is correct then
      it suggests that some concepts may be partially constituted by phenomenal content. This
      suggests in turn, that radically different phenomenology might make for conceptual differences
      sufficiently significant to constitute a difference in conceptual scheme. However, this
      possibility poses no threat to intra-specific understanding. The kind of phenomenal difference
      that can make for a difference in concept is limited primarily to creatures with different
      sense organs. Two creatures with radically different sense organs will have different
      conceptual schemes.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this thesis is to seek evidence that newspaper blogs build a sense of
      community, and whether that has an effect on reading behavior. The researcher conducted a
      survey that included questions about the blogs people read, the blocks on which they live, and
      their reading behavior. Findings suggest that the effects of high levels of community are
      cumulative; therefore, creating a blogging community can draw new readers-great news for
      newspaper marketers. Results from the study also suggest a virtuous cycle: frequent blog
      reading seems to lead to a sense of community, and vice versa.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper investigates digital art as a means with which to reflect on wider cultural
      patterns of everyday digital interactions. Specifically, it attends to an ongoing debate in
      new media studies focused on the relationship between digital technologies and narrative.
      Lured by the promise of libratory new narrative forms and utopic interactivity, much recent
      scholarship has been mired in the investigation of the narrative paradigm to the exclusion of
      potentially more useful concepts that directly acknowledge the sensing subject. This paper
      aims to illuminate the material digital aesthetic of ephemerality that increasingly supplants
      narrative primacy in the relationship between perception and digital realizations. Analysis of
      new media theorist Lev Manovich's algorithmically driven digital art project Soft Cinema, as
      well as other database-driven digital works, provides what I argue is a clearer set of tools
      with which to understand the relationship between temporality, materiality, digitality, and
      sensing bodies.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>As the costs associated with sponsoring NCAA Division I athletics increase, it is
      important that athletic administrators understand the role of money in intercollegiate
      athletics. The study investigated the relationship between team expenditures and national
      success in Olympic sports at NCAA Division I institutions. The study examined differences in
      median operating expenditures for teams at various levels of national success, defined by NCAA
      Championship tournament finish. It provides an empirical examination of the relationship in
      seven selected Olympic sports. For each sport, Division I teams were divided into four groups
      based on national success. The study compared the median expenditures for teams at each level
      of success to determine whether differences existed. The most successful teams were found to
      have reported the greatest median operating expenditures. The findings support the existence
      of a relationship between athletic expenditures and national success in the seven sports
      examined. Although limited to one academic year (2003-2004) and seven sports, the study
      indicates that money may be an important factor in athletic success in NCAA Division I
      athletics</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to create a profile of the 56 college football teams
      selected to play in Bowl Championship Series (BCS) bowl games from 1998 through 2004. A
      secondary purpose was to identify trends these profiles revealed. The results of this study
      were the profiles themselves and the information they shared about the teams. Specifically,
      this study showed 84% of teams had a top 20 pre-season ranking, 57% of teams had their
      strength of schedule rated outside the top 25, 95% of teams had recruiting classes ranked in
      the top 40, and as offenses improved, defenses weaken. This study provides a better
      understanding of past BCS bowl bound teams and could serve as a benchmark for athletic
      administrators to compare their own teams.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The Gastarbeiter and the subsequent Turkish-German community in Germany have prompted
      scholarly debate over the challenges such a settlement has posed to larger German society. Yet
      few among those involved in such discussions approach these issues from the perspective of the
      Turkish-German community and thus lack a critical viewpoint. This study seeks to address this
      limitation; yet, to do so, one must turn to less conventional sources. In the first chapter, I
      compare the historiography of Germany's Turkish minority to the literature of Turkish-German
      writers to determine how the addition of Turkish-German perspective complicates and fills out
      the findings of historians and social scientists. In the Chapter 2, I analyze films by
      Turkish-German directors and discuss what these works suggest about that community's
      development. Ultimately, I find that the Turkish-German artists and their creative works
      advocate and represent a blended identity that incorporates ethnic background and social and
      cultural experience.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The five-voice madrigal books of Claudio Monteverdi have long been regarded as
      masterworks of the genre, and have received much attention from musicologists. In the past,
      however, scholars have largely considered the books from an abstract, non-performative
      standpoint, and so have to an extent ignored the important information that can be gained
      through exploration of the more performative aspects of the compositions. This study aims at
      examining the voice ranges of Monteverdi's Mantuan madrigals from the standpoint of what they
      can tell us about the singers for whom Monteverdi was writing and about his changing style of
      vocal writing in the critical transition from the sixteenth to seventeenth centuries. In
      addition, through a more detailed examination of the Sixth Book, I suggest how this type of
      study might be further used in the future to help decide issues of uncertain chronology.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Public relations professionals need to understand their role in order to contribute,
      participate and potentially help shape the future of business through corporate social
      responsibility. This study examines how public relations is practiced in a socially
      responsible organization through a case study of a senior public relations manager working in
      a socially responsible company. The basic premise of this study is that public relations in a
      socially responsible organization will exhibit characteristics of
      "excellence" as defined by Grunig, Grunig, and Dozier (2002). Specifically
      this includes the organizational role enacted by the public relations professional and the
      model of practice employed by the public relations professional.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Control over work is a central concept in the sociology of work literature. Individual
      control over work, also referred to as job autonomy, entails that workers exercise choice and
      discretion over both substantive and procedural aspects of their jobs ranging from freedom at
      work to ability to schedule work. We can better comprehend differences in job autonomy by
      examining how both structural (occupational, organizational and authority relations) and
      demographic (gender, race, age, experience, education and family) forces can influence
      individual control over the substantive content and procedural terms of work. This
      dissertation seeks to better understand differences in job autonomy in the United States over
      a period of rapid change in the social organization of work. Since the 1970s, there have been
      dramatic shifts in the composition of the labor force, the degree of flexibility in
      organizational control systems, and composition of the occupational structure. In order to
      assess how changes in work structures and demographics impact job autonomy, I analyze this
      relationship at different points in time over a thirty-three year time period (1969-2002) by
      using ten data sets: The Survey of Working Conditions (1969), The Quality of Employment
      Surveys (1973 and 1977), Class Structure and Class Consciousness (1980), Comparative Project
      in Class Analysis (1991), General Social Survey (1991, 2002), and the National Study of the
      Changing Workforce (1992, 1997, 2002). The drive for flexibility has had implications for
      workers' job autonomy. The increased education of labor force coupled with the post-Fordist
      emphasis on functional flexibility and slight shift of the occupational structure towards more
      complex jobs has led to a general increase in control over content for American workers. While
      there has been an increase in some measures of control over terms of work, such as deciding
      breaks, flexibility for family or personal reasons has remained steady and even declined for
      men over the past thirty years. This comes as a result of increased pressures on male managers
      to put long hours in at work, and a general intensification and extension of effort and time
      within the workplace for all workers.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This analysis explores Nikolai Gogol's utilization of spatial models in his short
      story "The Carriage" and his epic novel Dead Souls in an attempt to deduce a
      connection between a character's physical environment and his potential for redemption. These
      works are unique in that they reflect two distinct periods of a highly formative time in
      Gogol's theological development. "The Carriage," the earlier published of
      the two, represents this period's point of departure, whereas Dead Souls conveys the output of
      Gogol's complex journey. Employing the insight of Iurii Lotman, this study examines first the
      dominance of evil in the "static" environments of these two works and then
      its subordination to "boundless" space in Dead Souls. To replace his
      dominant model of evil even temporarily, though, Gogol was forced to extend his vision
      limitlessly, a task that was ultimately more than he could bear.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Through a series of open-ended interviews, this study investigated the beliefs of six
      third year high school science teachers about how they implement science education reform
      ideals in their practice and the contextual challenges they face as they attempt to implement
      reform. The teachers argue that the lack of connection between their curricula and students
      lives serves as a significant obstacle to them utilizing more inquiry-based and
      student-centered strategies. In their science classes that are not subject to a high stakes
      exam, the teachers shared instances where they engage students in inquiry by reframing the
      focus of their curricula away from the decontextualized factual information and onto how the
      information relates to human experience. In their science classes subject to a high stakes
      test, however, the teachers confessed to feeling no choice but to utilize more
      teacher-centered strategies focused on information transmission. This study provides an in
      depth analysis of how the presence of high stakes tests discourages teachers from utilizing
      reform based teaching strategies within high school science classrooms.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Sudan's Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) is flawed and representative of many
      weaknesses of consociationalism. The CPA misunderstands the root causes of conflict in Sudan,
      oversimplifying Sudanese history to a conflict between particular groups in its Arab north and
      African south. In the CPA's efforts to mitigate the grounds for future conflict between the
      north and south, it divides the new Sudanese state largely between those groups. However,
      Sudan is much more complicated than the CPA suggests. The country is much better conceived as
      a scattering of peripheral regions, groups from which have recurrently battled the central
      state for fairer shares of public resources. These grievances motivate ongoing violence in
      western and eastern Sudan, where armed groups rebel against their marginalization from the
      CPA's state institutions; those grievances can be observed today within parts of the north and
      south, too. I conclude with recommendations for how the CPA should be amended.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>As Italian American writers, Anna Monardo and Tony Ardizzone explore the connection
      between language and the hybrid identity of Italian Americans. Ardizzone's chosen mode of
      narration is the folktale. He both uses old ones and creates his own, telling them in such a
      way that one sees the language and cultural heritage of the immigrants. In Italy, these
      folktales can be found in Italo Calvino's Fiabe Italiane. By reading Calvino, one can see how
      Ardizzone has mined and used the oral traditions of his ancestors. Monardo uses the
      acquisition of the Italian language of her protagonist as a widening of social space in a
      Bildungsroman novel that takes place two generations after the large immigration wave. This
      examination of the Italian language looks at its relation to Italy, to America, and to the
      confluence of the two in social, historical, and political contexts.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation examines the effect of the new and powerful newspaper corps on the
      rapidly deteriorating political environment in Rio de Janeiro in the waning years of the First
      Empire (1822-1831). The dissertation traces the lives of the major newspaper editors and
      attempts to show the impact their periodicals had on the political turmoil that characterized
      the last years of Emperor Pedro I's rule. Through an analysis of every extant newspaper
      originally published in Rio de Janeiro from 1827-1831, this dissertation concludes that
      editors had a significant role in events by providing a new and powerful forum for political
      debates outside of the strict confines of the state. The findings of this dissertation
      challenge the impression that the presence of a European monarch ensured Brazil's stability
      and cohesion, especially in the pivotal First Empire. The newspapers in Rio de Janeiro played
      a defining role in the direction of the state and encouraged an aware populace to defend the
      hitherto undefined nation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this dissertation is to evaluate how community stakeholder attitudes
      are influenced by marketplace advocacy, a type of issue advocacy that focuses on building
      acceptance for a product or service while addressing public concerns toward the product or
      service or the manufacturing processes associated with it. Specifically, the dissertation
      examines attitudes toward a coal industry-sponsored marketplace advocacy campaign seeking to
      gain acceptance for the coal industry and policies associated with coal mining within a
      resource community. Given their increased exposure to physical, environmental, and social
      risks, resource community stakeholders are an especially target audience for these campaigns
      since they live where the business or resource is located. The dissertation uses survey data
      and structural equation modeling to test a model of outcomes of issue advocacy examining how
      attitudes toward the coal industry are mediated by perceptions of trust in the industry,
      agenda building, and environmental concern. The dissertation suggests that campaign awareness
      heightens the salience of industry-promulgated issues among community stakeholders and
      directly influences perceptions of trust in the industry, including perceptions of corporate
      trustworthiness and public accountability. Both perceptions of trust in the industry and the
      salience of the campaign issues among community stakeholders mediate approval for the
      industry. Environmental concern moderates this relationship by lowering levels of trust in the
      industry. Secondary analyses also examine the strength of the three dimensions of
      accountability (intent, rule-based trust, and transparency) and the four agenda-building
      issues (economy, energy, environment, and community identity) in garnering approval for the
      industry. The results offer insight for researchers, professionals, and educators interested
      in understanding the persuasive potential of issue advocacy.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study examined the mediating effects of delinquent friendship networks on the
      relationship between self-esteem and delinquency in young adolescents using the data from the
      National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. This research expanded on previous research
      conducted by DuBois and Silverthorn (2004) by incorporating a comprehensive measure of
      friendship network delinquency. Principles of Social Learning Theory were also incorporated to
      explain why it is important to include a peer context in delinquency research. Additionally,
      this study included race and gender as moderator variables. Findings indicated that delinquent
      peer associations were significantly related to respondent delinquency in the White, male, and
      female participants. This relationship was not significant for African American participants
      suggesting an area for future research.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>After centuries of struggle with the Canadian state over access to natural resources,
      Mi'kmaq First Nations recently won a significant legal victory. In a 1999 ruling, the Supreme
      Court of Canada upheld 18th century treaties guaranteeing Mi'kmaq and their descendents the
      right to fish for profit in their traditional territories. This landmark ruling fundamentally
      reconfigured the landscapes where conflicts over Native rights and nature are waged. As a
      result, Mi'kmaq communities today are experiencing shifts in personal and collective
      constructions of meaning, practice and identity in the context of fisheries. Some community
      members advocate communally-based fisheries where profits are re-invested in the community,
      while others are approaching commercial fisheries in more individualistic ways. This paper
      explores the local and supralocal conditions under which Mi'kmaq people are relating to
      changes in the fisheries, drawing on social practice theory to consider how fishermen's
      identities are being reshaped through contentious practices and meaning-making.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The strong national emphasis contained in the works of Mexican Astrid Hadad and
      Chicana Mónica Palacios should distance them, since they come from different countries. Rather
      than that, the term "transnationalism" explains the similarities that will
      be analyzed between both contemporary women. The Mexico/US national borders crossed by means
      of "transnationalism" represent just one of the limitations that these women
      confront for not belonging to the "dominant" culture of their societies. The
      very genre that they work with, theater, is challenged by the relevance given to the elements
      added: dance, music, singing, visual elements and, in the case of Palacios, stand-up comedy.
      Both Hadad and Palacios have often been categorized as performance women because of this and
      the central role that their bodies achieve during their shows. This study links them first by
      focusing on the several historical traditions that have influenced them (diachronically) and,
      then, by analyzing the similar strategies with which they address oppression and create art
      (synchronically).</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Escorial III-K-4 contains a Spanish version of the Old French Vie de Sainte Marie
      l'Egyptienne (ms. B), the story of St. Mary of Egypt, a prostitute-turned penitent who is
      accepted into the Community of Saints. However, critics agree that the Spanish poem, Vida de
      Madona Santa María Egipciaqua is not just a translation, but an amplification that dramatizes
      further the character of Mary (Alvar 1967, 32-55; Cruz-Sáenz 115). This thesis studies the
      description of Mary of Egypt known as Vida de Madona Santa María Egipciaqua as an extreme
      expression of the conflict between the body and the will in order to find out what it tells us
      about the nature of the audience for which it was composed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Over the past 20 years the United States has experienced an influx of newly arriving
      immigrants. Furthermore, pre-emerging gatewayi states like North Carolina have seen Latino
      population growth in excess of 200% in metropolitan areas such as Charlotte and Raleigh-
      Durham. In fact, North Carolina has the fastest growing Latino population in the entire
      country. This study uses personal narratives to explore immigration patterns to North Carolina
      and the migration experience of Indigenous/Latino families, as well as, how immigrant
      communities are affected and produced by border crossings. In addition, this study also
      examines the effects of both migration patterns and experiences on schooling in North
      Carolina. The study follows a narration trajectory from participants. life experiences in
      countries of origin, during migration, as newly arrived immigrants, and life as an immigrant
      in North Carolina. Ethnographic methods such as personal narratives were used to collect
      detailed information about participants and their lives. The three largest and fastest growing
      immigrant populations found in this study were from Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador. i
      Pre-emerging gateways-are places that .had very small immigrant populations in the 1980 but
      experienced sudden very rapid growth in the 1990s.. (p. 7) All study participants had diverse
      language and cultural experiences representing over 17 Indigenous languages (other than
      Spanish) and five Indigenous groups. Further, study findings illustrate obstacles experienced
      by participants and their children (many who are U.S. born citizens) within schools. Lastly,
      the findings explore the birth of new transnational Indigenous/Latino communities of the South
      and considerations for the future of schooling in North Carolina and the American South.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Research has suggested that many adults do not participate in enough physical activity
      to achieve the associated health benefits. Compounding the problem of inactive leisure
      behaviors, modern workplace duties have also become less active. This study examined patterns
      of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and perceived constraints as related to job
      characteristics of 382 employees. Less than 8% of participants met the current physical
      activity recommendations. Females perceived a greater overall effect of constraints than
      males. Blue-collar workers perceived a greater effect of constraints than white-collar
      workers. A number of constraints dimensions significantly blocked participation. A number of
      strategies to encourage LTPA are presented, specifically including the removal or negotiation
      of time, individual/psychological and accessibility constraint dimensions.</mods:abstract>

      survey instrument is the Janssen Peak Performance Team Leadership Evaluation© consisting of 24
      questions with a 5-point Likert scale which will serve be used for 360-degree feedback, the
      three sources of evaluation being the leader, teammates and coaches. The results found the
      following significant. Coach evaluations for male leaders on team sports scored higher than
      those on individual sports. Self evaluations for male leaders on individual sports were higher
      than the coach evaluations had for them. Coach evaluations for male leaders on team sports
      scored higher than those of the female leaders. More specifically, the evaluations of the male
      coaches of female leaders were higher than the evaluations of their female coaches. Finally,
      there was a significant relationship between leadership by example and vocal leadership.</mods:abstract>

      trends in various periods of transition, analyzes the main actors in the transition and their
      different strategies, and finally tries to answer the question: why was the Russian media
      reform a failure?</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The current study utilized data for 64 African American adolescents and their parents
      to investigate the impact of warmth and conflict on parent-child agreement in reports of
      parental racial socialization. Fathers and children did not tend to agree on reports of
      parental racial socialization. In mother-child dyads, conflict, rather than warmth, moderated
      parentchild agreement. Contrary to hypotheses, however, higher levels of conflict were
      associated with higher levels of agreement. These findings suggest that low levels of conflict
      in adolescence may be reflective of low parent-child interaction overall whereas, high levels
      of conflict may indicate a developmentally appropriate healthy parent-adolescent relationship.
      Recommendations for future research include replication of this study using a larger sample
      size and further investigation of father roles.</mods:abstract>

      Planck scale and of black holes. We discuss the possibility that in quantum gravity scenarios
      the symmetry structure of flat space-time might deviate from the classical relativistic
      picture and lead to broken or deformed Poincar´e invariance. The striking feature of these
      "quantum" space-time models is the possibility that they might have
      experimentally observable effects. We discuss how a purely kinematical model within these
      frameworks, besides providing the threshold anomalies needed to explain the existence of
      above-GZK cosmic rays, can modify the Bachall-Waxman bound on the flux of neutrinos that are
      expected to be produced together with such cosmic rays. A relevant characteristic of
      "quantum" space-time scenarios with modifications of relativistic kinematics
      is the emergence of a Planck-scale particle localization limit that reflects the presence of
      the Planck length as an intrinsic spatial resolution limit for regimes in which quantum and
      gravitational effects are of the same magnitude. We propose a remarkable argument which
      relates the type of quantum gravity corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area
      relation for black holes and the form of the Planck-scale particle localization limit. Using
      this argument we are able to constraint the form of the deformed energy-momentum dispersion
      relation expected to emerge in the low-energy limit of loop quantum gravity. The same argument
      is then generalized to quantum gravity frameworks which predict a modifications of
      Heisenberg's uncertainty relation. We carried on a systematic study of the effects of modified
      energy-momentum dispersion relation and generalized uncertainty principle for an evaporating
      black hole obii taining also results for Planck-scale modifications of the spectrum of a
      radiating black-body. Finally, we extend our study of quantum gravity corrections to the
      Hawking radiation spectrum by adapting the tunneling picture proposed by Parikh and Wilczek
      including, in such a way, non-thermal corrections due to back-reaction of the emitted
      particle. It is also showed that a quantum fluctuating black hole horizon, characterized by a
      "quantum ergosphere" produces the same type of modification to the emission
      spectrum expected when higher order quantum gravity corrections to the entropy-area relation
      are present.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The study's author conducted a quantitative content analysis of ABC, CBS, and NBC
      nightly news programs. A stratified random sample of 2005 dates yielded a month's worth of
      broadcasts from each network. A total of 857 stories and 1530 sources were coded for a broad
      range of characteristics such as story topic, race of the reporter, race of the sources, and
      types of sources (e.g. private individual, expert, victim). Results show that Whites dominated
      television news coverage, comprising more than three quarters of the 1530 sources coded.
      Nearly 90% of network news reporters were also White. Elite sources such as experts, company
      spokespeople, and government officials were overwhelmingly White, whereas minority sources
      appeared most often as private individuals, or ordinary citizens. In addition, White sources
      clearly dominated all story topics, with a majority presence in every case, except for foreign
      affairs stories in which foreign sources made up the bulk of soundbites. Minority sources were
      scattered more sparingly across story topics, barely making a showing in some, such as stories
      about science/technology, foreign affairs, and electoral politics. Black and Hispanic sources
      appeared most often in stories about accidents/disasters/weather events, in both pre-Hurricane
      Katrina and post-Hurricane Katrina samples. Results indicated that minority reporters were
      more likely to use minority sources in their stories than White reporters were.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In the Metamorphoses of Apuleius, dreams, however bizarre, seem to have real
      significance for the waking world. The exact relationship of dreams to waking reality,
      however, is made ambiguous. Apuleius is thus able to present the most extraordinary event of
      all, the revelation of Isis and Lucius' conversion to her religion, in such a way that the
      narrative is protected from disbelief: since it is entirely directed and confirmed by a series
      of dreams, the possibility is left of interpreting it as a real event or as a fantasy. Two
      important effects result: 1) any reader's incredulity, which is inevitable, is directed
      towards the authority of dreams, rather than the authority of the narrator; 2) the suggestion
      is made that the story (especially since stories are closely related to dreams in this novel),
      no matter its relation to the real world, may still have real counsel for the reader.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Individuals with schizophrenia typically perform poorly on measures of executive
      function. This poor performance is widely attributed to disease-related neurocognitive
      deficits despite the fact that the role of motivational and interpersonal factors have not
      been adequately studied. In the present study, 30 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia
      completed two trials each of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, a measure of executive function.
      Between trials, half of the participants received enhanced instructions. It was hypothesized
      that this experimental group would achieve better WCST scores, and would also report exerting
      greater effort on the task, being more interested in the task, and experiencing better rapport
      with the experimenter than participants in the control group. Results showed significantly
      improved WCST performance in the experimental group relative to the control group. However,
      findings did not support the hypothesized group differences in effort, interest, and rapport.
      Implications are discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Simone Weil, Hannah Arendt and Herbert Marcuse are generally considered to be
      theorists quite distinct from one another. In this paper, I argue that there are notable
      similarities in their work, particularly with regards to their social and political critique
      of modern, technological society. Each of them emerged during World War II as social critics
      who attempted to trace the rise and success of totalitarian movements, while engaging with the
      most fundamental political issues of their times: collective action, the relationship of the
      individual to their society, and justice, among others. Using a selection of their most
      significant writings, I consider their views on freedom, rationality, and science and
      technology, along with their vision of politics, and emphasize their similar perspectives on
      these issues. I conclude with some deliberations about their core beliefs, and summarize the
      commitment of each to a post-totalitarian politics dedicated to the fulfillment of human
      potential.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This project compares the United States and Japan to test whether modern trends in
      family and work life have produced similar conceptions of gender ideology in both countries,
      or whether different cultural understandings of the same gender ideology questions remain.
      Differences in measurement between the two cultures must be taken into account before an
      accurate comparison of gender ideology in the U.S. and Japan is possible. This study uses
      eight items from the 2002 International Social Survey Program module "Family and
      Changing Gender Roles III" to test the measurement equivalence of gender ideology in
      the U.S. and Japan. Confirmatory factor analyses provide evidence of distinct underlying
      structures of gender ideology in the U.S. and Japan based on different ideas about the role of
      the housewife and personal fulfillment. However, a high level of measurement equivalence is
      found for the majority of gender ideology measures.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The study analyzed a nationally representative sample of first-time kindergarteners
      from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study - Kindergarten cohort of 1998-1999. Associations
      between sociodemographic risk factors, including race/ethnicity, poverty status, maternal
      education, child care participation, and residential location, and the dimension of approaches
      to learning for young children were analyzed at kindergarten entry. Race/ethnicity and
      maternal education predicted unique proportions of variance in children's approaches to
      learning (AL) at kindergarten entry. Race/ethnicity was associated with AL such that African
      American, Native American, and Hispanic children had the lowest scores on AL, while White and
      Asian children had the highest scores on AL. Maternal education was associated with AL such
      that children whose mothers had a four-year college degree or graduate/professional degree had
      higher AL scores than those whose mothers had any education less than a college degree.
      Implications of these findings for practice and policy are discussed.</mods:abstract>

      from sanctions contribute to increases in state-sponsored repression of physical integrity
      rights. I employ Maximum Likelihood Estimation techniques to test this relationship in a
      sample of 126 developing countries between 1976 and 2001. The results reveal that
      state-sponsored violations of physical integrity rights in the increase following the
      application of all US sanctions and comprehensive UN sanctions. This study further finds that
      the severity of the increase in physical repression is dependent on the type of sanctions
      imposed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Does having an incarcerated parent adversely affect the outcomes of children? Using
      the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), I explore if incarceration
      of a biological father leads to increased probability of criminal behavior and arrest among
      adult offspring. Analysis suggests that adult children of incarcerated parents are more likely
      to engage in criminal behavior and face encounters with the criminal justice system. With 2
      million individuals serving time in prison or jail in 2000 and the emergence of incarceration
      as a life-course event among less-educated males and minorities, intergenerational patterns of
      crime and incarceration may provide new context to the rapidly expanding prison population and
      the transmission of social disadvantage from parents to children.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper present a study of elite mortuary practices in the north coast of Ancient
      Perú, specifically at the regional cemetery of San José de Moro in the Jequetepeque-Chamán
      region during the Transitional period (circa A.D. 800-1000). During this period, the local
      elite mortuary tradition experienced changes and continuities as part of a major process of
      sociopolitical transformations during and after the collapse of the local Moche polity. As a
      case study that exemplifies this process, I present a description and analysis of Burial
      M-U615, an Early Transitional collective tomb associated with successive interments of local
      ceremonial leaders and members of their elite group. Comparing diverse characteristics of
      Burial M-U615 with previous Late Moche elite burials also allow me to explain elite mortuary
      practices as ideological mechanisms used in the legitimization of ceremonial leadership at San
      José de Moro during the Early Transitional phase.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis discusses the impact of genetics, personality traits and media on the
      development and continuation of eating disorders, including bulimia and anorexia. The project
      includes a literature review of current research on factors related to eating disorders. The
      series of three articles highlights three factors that affect the development of eating
      disorders. The first article considers some of the personality traits often associated with
      people with eating disorders, as told through one person's experience. The second uses a
      narrative approach to tell the story of a young girl who struggled with anorexia and binge
      eating and who also has a mother and half-sister who have dealt with eating disorders. The
      third article describes how media can affect how girls and women view their bodies and also
      reports on a recent movement toward using "real" women in advertising and in
      magazines directed to teenage girls.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study sought to offer a better understanding of the culture of RVing by exploring
      how full-time RVers describe the community to which they belong. This study was conducted in
      the interpretive paradigm using symbolic interactionism as the guiding framework. In-depth
      interviews were conducted with sixteen individuals who spent at least six months of every year
      residing in their recreational vehicle. Data were collected at campgrounds located in the
      American Midwest. An understanding of the values and customs of full-timers was gained through
      these conversational interviews that may be described as a balance of commitment. This balance
      of commitment was illustrated along a continuum called the concept of parsimonious commitment.
      This concept suggested that interviewees acted economically with their commitment to the
      community of RVers.whereas full-time RVers committed as much as necessary to gain the benefits
      of their community while taking care not to commit so much as to forfeit the freedom and
      autonomy that made the lifestyle of RVing so pleasurable.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Students, educators and journalism professionals agree that internships are the surest
      route to post-graduation employment in the newspaper industry. The three groups dedicate
      significant amounts of time and money to ensuring appropriate internship placements, but
      frustration persists on all sides. Using the newsgathering method outlined by Yopp and McAdams
      in 2003, this nontraditional thesis examines several structural factors of newspaper
      internships. Specifically, this includes the industry's trend toward offering fewer
      internships, racial and socioeconomic diversity issues, students' frustrations with the
      internship application process, and the difference in newspapers' philosophies for
      internships.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>European introduction of grazing livestock converted large areas of
      perennial-dominated native plant communities to exotic, mostly annual-dominated communities in
      much of the arid and semiarid western U.S. Grazing-induced type conversions of vegetation are
      particularly widespread in the Mediterranean-climate ecosystems of California, where exotic
      annual grasslands have largely replaced native shrublands and grasslands. Land managers are
      increasingly retiring arid and semiarid lands from grazing in an effort to reverse these
      changes and promote native vegetation recovery, but such recovery is often slow or
      nonexistent. Exotic grasslands can exhibit remarkable compositional stability even where
      native propagules are available. Where spontaneous recovery of native plant communities does
      occur, it tends to be spatially and temporally variable and seemingly unpredictable. Why some
      exotic-dominated communities are rapidly recolonized by native species upon release from
      grazing while others persist indefinitely is poorly understood. Long-term vegetation
      monitoring at the California Channel Islands provides an opportunity to determine factors
      associated with spontaneous recovery of native vegetation following the removal of nonnative
      herbivores. This study used time-series vegetation data and environmental data to identify
      patterns in post-grazing native vegetation recovery among taxa and environments, assess the
      utility of certain ecological theories in predicting recovery, and develop hypotheses about
      factors controlling native vegetation recovery. Site environmental characteristics explained
      post-grazing succession on the Channel Islands better than did ecological theories invoking
      biodiversity as a predictor or correlate. Exotic species richness and abundance consistently
      correlate with fine-grained substrates, and more generally with higher site heat load. Results
      suggest that competition for soil moisture is an important control on native vegetation
      recolonization. Response to grazing cessation also differed among taxa. Theoretically invasive
      traits did not predict differences in response among native woody species, but drought
      dormancy did, suggesting the importance of drought-coping strategies among taxa. Differential
      response among exotic species indicates possible post-grazing environmental changes and can
      inform prioritization of eradication efforts. Application of this type of trend analysis to
      the development of restoration goals and strategies is discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an area of research containing significant
      amounts of literature, yet little has been conducted from the perspective of the sports
      industry. This study employs a mixed-methods approach, including a survey and a qualitative
      content analysis, to explore how professional sports teams define CSR, who manages the issue
      within the organization, and how teams view CSR activities. Findings from this study indicate
      that community relations directors and team owners both influence CSR in the sports industry.
      Pertaining to the definition, the hierarchy of CSR categories in sports is different from
      other industries. Respondents viewed ethical concerns as the most significant, followed by
      philanthropic, legal, and then economic responsibilities. Furthermore, the qualitative content
      analysis uncovered additional elements of the CSR definition. This study ultimately poses a
      new definition of CSR relative to the sports industry.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Many urban revitalization programs focus policy resources on spatially defined target
      neighborhoods. The impacts of these programs can include direct effects in the neighborhood
      chosen for intervention and spillover effects in other neighborhoods. These unintended and
      sometimes unpredicted effects may be positive or negative. This dissertation argues that
      without analyzing the urban spatial structure as a set of inter-related housing submarkets,
      planners will not be able to adequately predict and evaluate the effects of revitalization
      policy. In doing so, the research investigates the theorized nature of neighborhoods,
      discussing this socio-cultural geography in light of the theorized nature of the housing
      market in space. The empirical investigation, a case study of Philadelphia, defines spatial
      housing submarkets as distinct market segments based on housing quality. These submarkets are
      compared with first the housing market implied by the theories of Alonso-Mills-Muth and
      Tiebout, and second with the defined policy neighborhoods. The city and metropolitan area of
      Philadelphia are found to be highly heterogeneous in housing types, with no uniform pattern
      predicted by theory. Additionally, policy target neighborhoods are often comprised of
      different submarkets, leading to confusion in policy targeting. This research suggests that
      urban planners should consider the geography of housing submarkets in developing
      revitalization policies in order to choose appropriate geographic targets and to predict the
      spatial extent of market responses.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>My dissertation has two principal aims. First, I develop a novel account of the
      meaning of ethical claims that provides a way to retain the advantages while overcoming
      problems with prominent descriptivist and noncognitivist metaethical accounts. Second, I show
      how this account extends naturally into an account of the meaning of epistemic claims in a way
      that can recast and begin to adjudicate recent metaepistemological debate between prominent
      contextualists and invariantists. Thus, in my dissertation the two central paradigms of
      normative discourse receive parallel treatment. Many philosophers treat ethical claims as
      descriptions of a special kind of fact, which raises difficult questions about the nature of
      ethical facts and our access to them. Other philosophers have argued that ethical clams are
      not descriptions but instead expressions of noncognitive attitudes, which avoids ontological
      and epistemological commitments but undercuts the apparent truth-evaluability and cognitive
      structure of ethical claims. My account of the meaning of ethical claims offers a third
      option, which I argue retains the benefits of descriptivism and noncognitivism while avoiding
      the drawbacks. To develop this view, I exploit the inferentialist idea that part of the
      meaning of ethical claims can be given in terms of what sort of commitment they express, where
      types of commitments are individuated by their inferential role. In brief, the thesis is that
      ethical claims express distinctively practical commitments. Although there is much recent
      debate about the truth-conditions of knowledge claims, many epistemologists have not even
      considered the epistemological parallel to the question at issue between ethical
      descriptivists and noncognitivists: What is the expressive role of knowledge claims? In the
      second part of this dissertation, I develop an inferentialist answer to this question modeled
      on my inferentialist version of ethical expressivism. The idea is to treat knowledge claims as
      the expression of a particular kind of distinctively practical commitment-roughly, it's the
      commitment to trust someone's judgment about some matter.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Snowfall in association with low-level winds out of the northwest is a common
      occurrence at higher elevations and along windward slopes in the Southern Appalachian
      Mountains. These northwest flow snow (NWFS) events typically have low temperatures and
      considerable blowing and drifting snow. Due to the high degree of spatial variability of
      snowfall and limited ability of numerical models to predict these events, forecasting NWFS
      remains a challenge. This dissertation analyzes the synoptic climatology of NWFS events in the
      Southern Appalachians for the period 1950 to 2000. Hourly observations from first-order
      stations, daily snowfall data from cooperative observer stations, and National Center for
      Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data are utilized to identify NWFS events, defined
      here as snow events with 850 hPa northwest flow (270 to 360 degrees) at the hour of greatest
      snow extent. Atmospheric fields of temperature, wind, moisture, and associated variables are
      analyzed for heavy and light snowfalls separately by calculating composite field values and
      constructing composite plots of the synoptic patterns. The NOAA Hysplit Trajectory Tool is
      used to calculate 72-hour antecedent upstream air trajectories, and composite trajectories are
      mapped in a geographic information system (GIS). The sample of events in the trajectory
      analysis is limited to those with synoptic-scale subsidence, a frequent occurrence with NWFS.
      Analyses of vertical soundings are coupled with NCEP data to iv determine the synoptic
      characteristics associated with different air trajectories. Results indicate that NWFS
      accounts for as much as 56 percent of mean annual snowfall along the higher elevation windward
      slopes. Heavy NWFS events are tied to higher values of synopticscale ascent and relative
      humidity in the lower troposphere, as well as lower 500 hPa heights and longer event
      durations. Additionally, upstream air trajectories with a Great Lakes connection have higher
      composite mean areal and maximum point snowfall totals along the higher elevation windward
      slopes than other northwest trajectories. Little Great Lakes influence is noted at lower
      elevations and on leeward slopes.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation foregrounds boundary crossing among American Indians, African
      Americans, and Euramericans as a central feature of American literature. The authors
      discussed, including James Fenimore Cooper, William Faulkner, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, and
      Leslie Marmon Silko, place this cross-cultural contact in nature, not only collapsing cultural
      and racial boundaries, but also complicating divisions between "wilderness"
      and "civilization." Responding to contemporary theoretical approaches to
      race, culture, and nationhood, this dissertation points toward the multiple perspectives and
      cultures that distinguish American literature as well as highlights the role of geography in
      these critical discourses, forging a connection between ecological theory and ethnic studies.
      Whereas Euramerican writers demonstrate multi-racial coexistence on the frontier as idyllic
      yet fleeting due to national expansion, African American and Native writers reverse this
      model, identifying Black-Indian alliance as the source of resistance to colonization and
      environmental degradation. This study thereby probes the prominent roles that American Indians
      occupy in major American novels, not only as emblems of ecological acumen, but more important,
      as participants in cultural exchange that informs American identity.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Sponges (phylum Porifera) evolved in Precambrian times, and research suggests that
      many sponge species began associations with large, diverse microbial communities early in
      their evolutionary history. This long history of close interactions suggests that the
      relationships are beneficial to both partners, but there is little conclusive evidence to
      support this hypothesis. By comparing sponge species with large, diverse microbial
      communities, termed high microbial abundance (HMA) sponges, to sponge species nearly devoid of
      associated bacteria, termed low microbial abundance (LMA) sponges, my research sought to test
      the hypotheses of positive microbial influences on sponges and that a symbiosis exists between
      the partners. HMA sponges were found to have significantly higher tissue densities,
      significantly lower in situ pumping rates, and significantly different in situ fluxes of
      various nitrogen species, suggesting that bacteria influenced the morphology, physiology, and
      nitrogen budget of their host sponges. Measurements of stable carbon and nitrogen isotope
      ratios of bulk sponge tissue for a variety of sponges from the Florida Keys, North Carolina,
      and Papua New iv Guinea revealed that although carbon metabolism is most influenced by
      habitat, nitrogen metabolism varies with species, with most HMA sponges showing low nitrogen
      isotopic ratios generally indicating microbial metabolic processes. Transmission electron
      microscopy and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of two HMA sponges and an LMA sponge
      allowed me to characterize a portion of the microbial communities of the HMA sponges and to
      confirm the lack of extensive and diverse microbial communities among LMA sponges. Because
      anaerobic microbes were found in the HMA sponges, I used submersible oxygen microsensors and
      tetrazolium salts to detect in situ zones of hypoxia within sponge tissue, and found hypoxia
      in HMA sponges but not in LMA sponges. Finally, I measured the stable carbon and nitrogen
      isotope ratios of spongin fibers, which makes up the sponge skeleton, and sponge larvae or
      embryos, and found evidence of a transfer of nitrogen between the sponges and their associated
      bacteria. My research supports the hypothesis that HMA sponge evolution and ecology is
      impacted by their associated microbial community and that this community directly benefits the
      host sponge, resulting in a symbiotic relationship.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>I present time-varying Reeb graphs as a topological framework to support the analysis
      of continuous time-varying data. Such data is captured in many studies, including
      computational fluid dynamics, oceanography, medical imaging, and climate modeling, by
      measuring physical processes over time, or by modeling and simulating them on a computer.
      Analysis tools are applied to these data sets by scientists and engineers who seek to
      understand the underlying physical processes. A popular tool for analyzing scientific datasets
      is level sets, which are the points in space with a fixed data value s. Displaying level sets
      allows the user to study their geometry, their topological features such as connected
      components, handles, and voids, and to study the evolution of these features for varying s.
      For static data, the Reeb graph encodes the evolution of topological features and compactly
      represents topological information of all level sets. The Reeb graph essentially contracts
      each level set component to a point. It can be computed efficiently, and it has several uses:
      as a succinct summary of the data, as an interface to select meaningful level sets, as a data
      structure to accelerate level set extraction, and as a guide to remove noise. I extend these
      uses of Reeb graphs to time-varying data. I characterize the changes to Reeb graphs over time,
      and develop an algorithm that can maintain a Reeb graph data structure by tracking these
      changes over time. I store this sequence of Reeb graphs compactly, and call it a time-varying
      Reeb graph. I augment the time-varying Reeb graph with information that records the topology
      of level sets of all level values at all times, that maintains the correspondence of level set
      components over time, and that accelerates the extraction of level sets for a chosen level
      value and time. Scientific data sampled in space-time must be extended everywhere in this
      domain using an interpolant. A poor choice of interpolant can create degeneracies that are
      difficult to resolve, making construction of time-varying Reeb graphs impractical. I
      investigate piecewise-linear, piecewise-trilinear, and piecewise-prismatic interpolants, and
      conclude that piecewise-prismatic is the best choice for computing time-varying Reeb graphs.
      Large Reeb graphs must be simplified for an effective presentation in a visualization system.
      I extend an algorithm for simplifying static Reeb graphs to compute simplifications of
      time-varying Reeb graphs as a first step towards building a visualization system to support
      the analysis of time-varying data.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This research explores the relationship between the social and economic changes
      associated with the development process and demographic change in Nang Rong, a relatively poor
      district in Thailand's Northeast province. I focus on the ways in which the development
      process encourages changes in fertility and migration behavior, and how these two demographic
      processes are related to each other. By exploring this relationship in a context of rapid
      social, economic, and demographic change, and by focusing on a much finer level of analysis
      than is typical (individual, household, and community), this research provides a number of
      insights into the relationship between development and demographic behavior that may be
      applied in other situations of rapid change. This dissertation is organized around three
      related studies. The first examines how the development process influences fertility and
      migration behavior, drawing on a modified version of the Multiphasic Response Theory to guide
      the analyses. I use a parallel modeling strategy using logistic regression techniques to
      explore both how fertility and migration behavior are responsive to development, and how these
      are related. The results lend support to the validity of the theoretical model, and suggest it
      may be successfully applied in other settings. The second study focuses on the ways in which
      fertility behavior is influenced by migration status and lifetime experience with urban
      residence, focusing on both how this differs for short- and long-term migrants and for
      individuals at different stages of family formation. I use event history analysis to explore
      this issue, and specifically examine the role of migrant selectivity and the potential
      endogeneity of migration and fertility in shaping this relationship. The results suggest that
      the effect of migration in this setting is contingent on family formation stage, and is
      closely tied to marriage. The final study examines how the contraceptive behavior of women in
      Nang Rong is influenced by both past and present context, focusing on the role of community
      contraceptive use. The results indicate that behavior is influenced primarily by current
      context, but that past context continues to exert an influence on behavior through 'setting
      the stage' for current context.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine the working relationships between the inhouse
      and outsourced marketing groups of major NCAA Division I athletics programs. Forty-four
      outsourced general managers (GMs) and 39 senior in-house marketing administrators (SMAs)
      participated for a response rate of 69.2%. Descriptive analysis indicated the firms were
      similar in regards to office location, amount of contact, work experience, and pressure. The
      data also indicated possible inherent differences between the outsourced and in-house realms.
      Actual outsourced pressure exceeded in-house pressure, and the GMs and SMAs tended to
      overstate their counterparts' pressure levels. Also, GMs had more experience working in-house
      than SMAs had working for outsourced firms. Responses from GMs and SMAs indicated a healthy
      relationship despite the presence of the arms race in college athletics, as each group
      exhibited tendencies of conceding portions of their own ideals for the benefit of the overall
      working relationship.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The East China Sea continental margin is characterized by abundant sediment supply,
      high energy, and a unique shelf physiography - a fairly shallow shelf with a low gradient,
      extreme width, and deep shelf-slope break. Three sequences are chronologically constrained by
      core data in the shallow strata from the late Pleistocene to present. Regional seismic
      surveys, collected as part of a broader investigation, provide unique observations unavailable
      to previous studies. A revised stratigraphy is presented that provides an alternate
      stratigraphic framework and, in the process, clarifies existing ECS stratigraphic
      nomenclature. In these strata, the lowstand fluvial systems, prior to oxygen isotope stage 4
      do not incise the East China Sea continental margin. Instead, they comprise laterally
      (&gt;400 km) and vertically (&gt;40 m) extensive sand sheets interpreted as low-energy
      and low-sinuosity fluvial braidplains dominated by bed load. It is suggested in this paper
      that the rare nature of lowstand unincised fluvial systems (LUFS) are related to the rare
      nature of the extreme depositional boundary conditions forming the LUFS on continental margins
      (i.e., low gradient, deep shelf-slope break, abundant sediment supply). Extensive (&gt;100
      km), unincised fluvial sheet sands resembling the LUFS from the ECS margin are preserved in
      foreland basins throughout the Phanerozoic. Because this stratal architecture is similar to
      the LUFS preserved on the ECS margin, it may have been created under similar depositional
      conditions. In order to better understand stratal sensitivity under these conditions, a
      three-dimensional, forward simulator (fuzzyPEACH) was developed. In this investigation,
      numerous scenarios of eustasy, tectonic subsidence, and sediment influx were simulated. The
      various rates and magnitudes of eustatic fluctuations may also be used as a proxy for the
      effect of margin physiography on stratal geometry, although fuzzyPEACH allows the geometry to
      be user defined. FuzzyPEACH simulations collectively uses only five FISs containing a total of
      21 separate rules. These rules incorporate 15 variables and are defined by 47 fuzzy sets.
      Fuzzy logic was chosen for its ability to quantify subjectivity, by capturing the vagueness of
      linguistic terms, and assemble a robust fuzzy logic inference system, in relatively short
      order, that can describe complex, nonlinear relationships.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Failures in political representation are a key hindrance to the quality of democracy
      in Latin America, and the degree to which parties link to voters on a programmatic basis is
      crucial for the quality of representation. This dissertation analyzes the nature of
      party-voter linkages in two highly institutionalized party-systems of the region: Chile and
      Uruguay. Both cases should produce highquality representation given certain important
      preconditions: partisan capacities, democratic contestation opportunities, and potential for
      grievance mobilization. However, this work shows that even in these best case scenarios the
      possibilities for structuring programmatic representation in contemporary Latin America are
      low. I explain differences in political representation through a framework of conjunctural
      causation that incorporates the long-term evolution of social and state structures into the
      analysis of party-systems and party-voter linkage configurations. Performing a multi-level
      comparison combining survey research and extensive fieldwork in paired-sample districts
      representing divergent causal configurations, I explain predominant linkage configurations in
      each country and district. My evidence shows that: a) while in the 1990s programmatic linkages
      have weakened in Chile, they have strengthened in Uruguay; b) significant levels of
      socioeconomic segmentation of programmatic linkages exist in Chile with upper classes linking
      to parties according to their programmatic preferences, while low-educated voters present
      extreme programmatic confusion and a combination of alienation from politics and instances of
      strongly localized, non-partisan (personalized), and non-programmatic linkages with candidates
      (financed by private-sector contributions, illegal municipal contracting, or focalized social
      policy); c) in Uruguay, economic crises have weakened traditional parties' clientelistic
      machines, reinforcing discontent with both parties and generating the opportunity for the
      leftwing Frente Amplio to grow by programmatically opposing neoliberal reforms; d)
      nonetheless, in a relatively favorable systemic context, a weaker pattern of segmented linkage
      strategies also emerged in Uruguay. Institutional and elite-centered analyses have
      predominated in the literature on political representation. The main theoretical contribution
      of this work is to bring society and informal institutions 'back in' to the analysis. This
      provides a more comprehensive understanding of the complex combination of variables that
      interact --usually over a long period of time--to cause different patterns of
      "representation" in a given society.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Over the last decade interest in the possibility of plastic electronics,
      semi-conducting organic materials that hold the potential for display devices with improved
      characteristics, has increased. To date, the majority of research has focused on material
      development and device design. However, if scientists are able to understand the connection
      between the structural and electronic properties of molecules, they can tailor new compounds
      with desired physical characteristics. Optical characterization is the first step to
      understanding the structural properties of materials. This work focuses on characterizing
      single crystals of two specific molecules: alpha-hexathiophene and 5,6,11,12-tetraphenyl
      tetracene (rubrene). While there is plenty of information currently available in the
      literature about alpha-hexathiophene, the resonant Raman experiments I describe in chapter 3
      have uncovered the lowest experimentally-recorded excited electronic levels. I have
      tentatively identified these states as either a triplet Frenkel exciton or a bound singlet
      Frenkel exciton. Chapter 4 details how I used Raman, infrared and photoluminescence
      spectroscopy, as well as computer simulations, to characterize rubrene. Studies of tetracene
      single crystals helped guide the understanding of the structural and electronic properties of
      rubrene. Although all molecular crystals have low intermolecular coupling, my analysis showed
      that rubrene has particularly low coupling, even for a molecular crystal. This result goes
      against commonly held belief that the best molecules for plastic electronic devices should
      have strong 1/4-electron overlap. The temperature dependent photoluminescence spectrum clearly
      reveals emission from free carriers as well as free charge transfer excitons, free Frenkel
      excitons and deep impurity and defect levels.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Networking technology has become applicable in domains beyond the conventional
      computer. One such domain currently receiving a significant amount of research attention is
      networking arbitrary devices such as TVs, refrigerators, and sensors. In this dissertation, we
      focus on the following question: how does an infrastructure deploy a user-interface for a
      single device or a composition of several ones? We identify and evaluate several deployment
      approaches. The evaluation shows the approach of automatically generating device
      user-interfaces 'on the fly' as particularly promising since it offers low
      programming/maintenance costs and high reliability. The approach, however, has the important
      limitation of taking a long time to create a userinterface. It is our thesis that it is
      possible to overcome this limitation and build graphical and speech user-interface generators
      with deployment times that are as low as the inherently fastest approach of locally loading
      predefined code. Our approach is based on user-interface retargeting and history-based
      generation. User-interface retargeting involves dynamically mapping a previously generated
      user-interface of one device to another (target) device that can share the user-interface.
      History-based generation predicts and presents just the content a user needs in a device's
      user-interface based on the user's past behavior. By filtering out unneeded content from a
      screen, it our thesis that history-based generation can also be used to address the issue of
      limited screen space on mobile computers. The above ideas apply to both single and multiple
      device user-interfaces. The multidevice case also raises the additional issue of how devices
      are composed. Current infrastructures for composing devices are unsuccessful in simultaneously
      providing high level and flexible support of all existing composition semantics. It is our
      thesis that it is possible to build an infrastructure that: (1) includes the semantics of
      existing high-level infrastructures and (2) provides higher-level support than all other
      infrastructures that can support all of these semantics. Such an infrastructure requires a
      composition framework that is both data and operation oriented. Our approach is based on the
      idea of patternbased composition, which uses programming patterns to extract data and
      operation information from device objects. This idea is used to implement several abstract
      algorithms covering the specific semantics of existing systems.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Corporations are now exploring the value of blogs as a marketing tool. This thesis
      investigates how corporate bloggers in the technology industry are using this new technique to
      communicate with customers. One blogger from each of the following companies: Cisco, IBM, HP,
      Microsoft, Sun, Adobe, Accenture, Red Hat, Oracle, and BEA, was interviewed through a series
      of on-line interviews. Using a basis of two-way communication theory, the interviews explored
      whether there is an effective blogging model technology companies can use and if blogs are a
      viable marketing tool for technology companies. Results demonstrate that blogs are a viable
      tool in the marketing mix, but this study was inconclusive in providing a model for other
      technology companies to adopt.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Today, the Venerable Bede's (672/3-735) Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (HE) is
      widely considered one of the great works of early medieval historical writing. In the Middle
      Ages, it was widely known and also greatly admired, but for very different reasons. This
      dissertation examines two aspects of the HE's popularity in the medieval period: First, it is
      a study of the transmission of the work in medieval Germany, a region where the text enjoyed
      great success. Second, it is an analysis of the manuscript evidence for the text's reception
      in the German-speaking world. After a brief introduction in Chapter One, Chapter Two surveys
      the history of the study of the manuscript tradition of the HE, and groups the manuscripts of
      the German "textual province" on the basis of test collations. The test
      collations are given in full in Chapter Three. In Chapters Four and Five, the focus shifts to
      the reception of the text, first (in Chapter Four) with an analysis of the text's manuscript
      context (including mise-en-page, marginalia, and associated works), as a way of getting at its
      readership. In Chapter Five, the focus is on the text's library context, that is, it is an
      examination of the libraries known to have held copies of the HE, and the ways the text seems
      to have fit into those collections, based primarily on the evidence of medieval library
      catalogues. Finally, Chapter Six provides a brief concluding summary that emphasizes how the
      interests of the medieval readers of the HE differed from those of its modern readers, and
      particularly how the medieval German audience of the work was most interested in the
      "universal" Christian elements in Bede's text, especially the lives of
      popular saints, their miracles, and otherworld visions. The Appendices include a manuscripts
      finding-list, and a transcription of two hitherto unrecognized copies of the socalled
      Continuatio Bedae from Prague and Vienna.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study is an attempt to both uncover and challenge the adherence to colorblind
      views and practices of white teachers with regard to race and racism in schools. Employing a
      performance ethnography approach, the study attempts to position white teachers as both
      unintentionally supportive of and potentially resistant to institutional structures and
      ideologies that marginalize students of color. The performance approach also positions these
      teachers as co-performers in the research act itself, thus close attention is paid to what
      they can offer towards the goal of challenging colorblindness. Particular attention is paid to
      the potentially educative aspects of Critical Race Theory (CRT) as a tool that can be used to
      promote and analyze dialogue with white teachers about race. By using CRT in this dialogic
      fashion, the study can focus on the complexity and contractions involved in teachers'
      approaches to racial equity. Specifically, the teachers in this study both support and resist
      colorblind approaches to such equity, and CRT as a motivation and tool of analysis enables the
      study to focus on the possibility of fostering more critical antiracist practice.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>We consider a manufacturer that offers two types of prioritized warranties for its
      product. Type 1 warranty guarantees a shorter turnaround time than type 2 warranty. Hence
      items covered by type 1 warranty receive higher priority in repair service. When an item under
      warranty fails, the manufacturer sends it to one of several repair vendors for repair, who are
      under contracts to provide repair service for the manufacturer. The manufacturer pays each
      vendor a fixed fee per repair assignment. While an item is at the vendor under or awaiting
      repair, a linear holding cost is incurred by the vendor and a linear good-will cost is
      incurred by the manufacturer. We first study the admission control problem for a single vendor
      that can either accept or reject an incoming repair assignment in order to maximize its own
      profit. We analyze the optimal control policies under three criteria: individual optimization,
      class optimization, and social optimization. By exploiting two proof methods, value iteration
      algorithm and sample path analysis, we prove that the optimal policy under each criterion has
      switching-curve structure. We also compare the optimal policies under the three criteria
      mentioned above and show that (i) the class-optimal policy accepts more high priority
      customers but fewer low priority customers than the socially optimal policy, which has
      interesting socioeconomic connotation, (ii) the individually optimal policy accepts more high
      priority customers than the class-optimal policy, while it can accept either more or fewer
      low-priority customers than either of the other two optimal policies. We then consider the
      warranty repair allocation problem which the manufacturer faces. The manufacturer's goal is to
      allocate the repair work in such a way that the total cost (including fixed cost and good-will
      cost) is minimized. The complexity of the problem makes the attempt to find the optimal policy
      very unlikely to succeed. Therefore, we turn our attention to heuristic routing procedures. We
      develop an effective and robust index-based policy by applying a single policy improvement
      step to a well-chosen static routing policy. We evaluate the index-based policy and compare it
      with other heuristics via simulation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The optical properties of spin cast thin films of
      N,N'-bis(3-phenoxy-3-phenoxyphenoxy)- 1,4,5,8-naphthalene-tetracarboxylic diimide (NDA-n2) and
      N,N'-bis(3-phenoxyphenoxy)- 1,4,5,8-naphthalene-tetracarboxylic diimide (NDA-n1) were
      investigated using spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) complimented by optical absorption
      spectroscopy in the visible-near UV optical range and atomic force microscopy (AFM) for
      surface roughness. A combination of Tauc-Lorentzian and Gaussian oscillators model was used to
      fit the measurements obtained from SE. Film roughness results were also evaluated in the
      optical model using Bruggman Effective Medium Approximation (BEMA). The effect of different
      spin deposit conditions including spin speed, concentration of solution and deposition ambient
      on the NDA's film thickness, surface roughness, optical properties and optical anisotropy have
      been investigated. No anisotropy has been found for the spin cast film and moderate
      temperature annealing in high vacuum leads to film densification. Organic thin film
      transistors (OTFT's) were fabricated with NDA'sas the active semiconductor layer, silicon
      dioxide (SiO2) as the gate dielectric, heavily doped silicon as the substrate, and vacuum
      evaporated gold lines as the source and drain contacts. The electronic properties were
      characterized using a custom built probe station. The custom probe station was automated with
      software program written in LabVIEW™. NDA'syielded a P-channel device. From transfer
      characteristic and turn-on plot, the charge mobility was calculated which was in the range of
      about 10-2 cm2 V-1 s-1. Various post fabrication processes were carried out to optimize the
      device performance. Bottom contact configuration has shown higher charge mobility than top
      contact in this study. Moderate temperature annealing in high vacuum has improved the device
      mobility by several orders, yielding evidence for a hopping mechanism for charge transport in
      NDA's. The high mobility of NDA-n1 compared with NDA-n2 demonstrated that aryl-ether tail
      group hindered the charge transport in the film. Two alternate gate dielectric layers for the
      OTFT were also considered; while a non-polar low-K dielectric, polyethylene improved mobility;
      polar high-K dielectric, copolymer of vinylidene fluoride with trifluoroethylene had an
      adverse effect on mobility.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation interrogates the identifying category "cultural
      Catholic" in the United States and distinguishes the overarching elements that
      contribute to its construction and development. I argue that a deliberate connection to the
      Catholicism of one's past-and its authoritative contexts-constitutes the key component of
      cultural Catholicism. Adults, removed from their childhood environments and reflecting on the
      influence of their religious upbringings, use narrative to highlight distinct circumstances
      that had long-lasting impacts. Selectively emphasizing particular memories, cultural
      Catholics, from a variety of geographic, ethnic and economic origins, construct similar
      pictures of their childhood environments. With this range of possible sources available, I
      have limited this investigation to texts by authors who were born between 1940 and 1965 and
      who self-identify as having been raised Catholic. This first generation of cultural Catholics
      highlights three contexts of Catholic authority in mid-twentieth century America-the
      institutional Church, the family home, and the ethnic neighborhood-where, as children, they
      encountered definitive responsibilities and expectations. Their narratives emphasize the
      powerful Catholic forces occupying these different spaces. However, through the process of
      writing about their early religious experiences, they effectively reclaim a sense of agency
      regarding those environments. Cultural Catholics exhibit a sense of power over their Catholic
      past and assume control of the way it takes shape in history. Further, they establish
      themselves in a new segment of society, one removed from their particularized origins and
      comfortably settled in professional surroundings, precisely by invoking the past in specific
      ways. Their stories allow them to perpetuate their connection to the tradition and communities
      that formed them. However, in the process, they construct a new position that allows them to
      be prominent figures in secular settings and still deeply shaped by the Catholic influences
      that characterized their youth.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Physical punishment is a disciplinary technique that many parents utilize and report
      as being effective. Nevertheless, researchers continue to debate its usefulness and impact on
      child adjustment. Many have argued that physical punishment is detrimental to children's
      socio-emotional functioning, and in particular, that it increases aggression. However, some
      have argued that whether parents utilize physical punishment is less important than how they
      use it, citing strong evidence that not all children who are spanked display abnormal levels
      of aggression. This has lead to the theory that various parenting characteristics and
      techniques may moderate the relationship between physical punishment and aggression. The
      current study examines parental warmth as a moderator of the relationship between physical
      punishment and aggression 30 months later. Results of the study yielded no evidence that this
      relationship exists. Several limitations are believed to have contributed to the null
      findings. Directions for future research are discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Academic librarians should explore new approaches to the assessment of information
      literacy skills. Satisfaction surveys and input/output measures do not provide librarians with
      adequate information about what students know and can do. Standardized multiple-choice tests
      and large-scale performance assessments also fail to provide the data librarians need to
      improve instruction locally. Librarians, facing accountability issues and possessing the
      desire to improve student learning, require a new approach to library instruction assessment.
      This study investigated the viability of a rubric approach to information literacy assessment
      and examined an analytic information literacy rubric designed to assess students' ability to
      evaluate website authority. The study addressed these questions: (1) To what degree can
      different groups of raters provide consistent scoring of student learning artifacts using a
      rubric? (2) To what degree can raters provide scores consistent with those assigned by the
      researcher? (3) To what degree can students use authority as a criterion to evaluate websites?
      This study revealed that multiple raters can use rubrics to produce consistent scoring of
      information literacy artifacts of student learning; however, different groups of raters in
      this study arrived at varying levels of agreement. For example, ENG 101 instructors produced
      significantly higher reliabilities than NCSU librarians and ENG 101 students, and NCSU
      librarians produced remarkably higher levels of agreement than external instruction and
      reference librarians. In addition to providing important findings regarding the five original
      rater groups, this study documented the emergence of an "expert" rater
      group, identified through kappa statistics and a "gold standard" approach to
      the examination of validity. These raters not only approximated the researcher's scores, they
      also achieved higher levels of agreement than any of the five original groups. This study
      suggests that librarians may require substantial training to overcome barriers blocking expert
      rater status. Finally, this study found that most students can cite specific indicators of
      authority when evaluating a website. Nearly all students can locate and identify these
      authority indicators in a website. However, many students have difficulty choosing an
      appropriate website for a specific assignment and providing a rationale for their choice.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study examined the impact of the middle generation on the grandparentgrandchild
      bond. Specifically, I was interested in how the parent as gatekeeper mediates closeness and
      self-disclosure with a maternal grandmother at two different stages of the life course, ages
      10-17 and 18-23. The younger focal children were twice as likely as the older focal children
      to confide in a grandmother they feel emotionally close to. For both age groups, the focal
      child-mother (G2-G3) relationship is positively associated with grandchildgrandmother (G1-G3)
      relationship. The mother-grandmother (G1-G2) relationship is significantly associated with
      grandchild-grandmother (G1-G3) closeness for both age groups, but this is especially true for
      the older focal children. For the younger focal children, mothergrandmother (G1-G2) closeness
      is related to G1-G3 self-disclosure. Among the older focal children, level of closeness
      between the mother and focal child is related to whether the older focal children will confide
      in their grandmother.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The geometric and optical complexity of ice has been a constant source of wonder and
      inspiration for scientists and artists. It is a defining seasonal characteristic, so modeling
      it convincingly is a crucial component of any synthetic winter scene. Like wind and fire, it
      is also considered elemental, so it has found considerable use as a dramatic tool in visual
      effects. However, its complex appearance makes it difficult for an artist to model by hand, so
      physically-based simulation methods are necessary. In this dissertation, I present several
      methods for visually simulating ice formation. A general description of ice formation has been
      known for over a hundred years and is referred to as the Stefan Problem. There is no known
      general solution to the Ste- fan Problem, but several numerical methods have successfully
      simulated many of its features. I will focus on three such methods in this dissertation: phase
      field methods, diffusion limited aggregation, and level set methods. Many different variants
      of the Stefan problem exist, and each presents unique challenges. Phase field methods excel at
      simulating the Stefan problem with surface tension anisotropy. Surface tension gives
      snowflakes their characteristic six arms, so phase field methods provide a way of simulating
      medium scale detail such as frost and snowflakes. However, phase field methods track the ice
      as an implicit surface, so it tends to smear away small-scale detail. In order to restore this
      detail, I present a hybrid method that combines phase fields with diffusion limited
      aggregation (DLA). DLA is a fractal growth algorithm that simulates the quasi-steady state,
      zero surface tension Stefan problem, and does not suffer from smearing problems. I demonstrate
      that combining these two algorithms can produce visual features that neither method could
      capture alone. Finally, I present a method of simulating icicle formation. Icicle formation
      corresponds to the thin-film, quasi-steady state Stefan problem, and neither phase fields nor
      DLA are directly applicable. I instead use level set methods, an alternate implicit front
      tracking strategy. I derive the necessary velocity equations for level set simulation, and
      also propose an efficient method of simulating ripple formation across the surface of the
      icicles.</mods:abstract>

      manufacturers have developed and augmented since the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (MSA). A
      literature review examines recent academic research on cigarette advertising strategies and
      smoking behavioral patterns. Three stories, written in the style of in-depth newspaper
      articles, each cover one new development. The first article discusses the growth of cigarette
      advertising and promotions at the point of sale, as well as how these promotions have affected
      how some retailers run their businesses. The second article explores cigarette promotions in
      bars and nightclubs and tells the story of one cigarette promotion in a Raleigh bar. The third
      article discusses flavored cigarettes and the legal challenges that they have faced since
      entering the mass market.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>At first blush, mental content externalism and justification internalism seem
      incompatible. If some of the content of my mental states supervenes on factors external to me,
      the content of these mental states might be unavailable to me. If the factors relevant to the
      justification of my beliefs are the relations between the contents of my beliefs, and I do not
      have access to these contents, then these beliefs cannot be justified internally. I propose to
      reconcile mental content externalism with justification internalism by taking the factors
      relevant to the justification of a belief to be the relations between how one would express
      one's beliefs, not between the contents of those beliefs. Though mental content externalism
      may somewhat restrict an agent's self knowledge, it could not restrict an agent from knowing
      how he would express his beliefs, and therefore would not hinder his access to the relevant
      justificatory factors.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>From November of 2003 to the present, I have gotten to know a group of primarily
      disabled coal miners in southwest Virginia. Their stories are powerful, poignant, and deeply
      embedded in the ambiguities of daily living with death in the mines. The complex web of social
      and kinship networks, body politics, and economic in/stability is wound around one substance,
      coal, and their daily doing of working in the mines, even as that same work has un-done these
      miners through severed limbs, dis-abled bodies, and the psychological wounding of watching
      loved ones become crushed in mining rock falls. Their richly-textured stories are often
      silenced under dominant narratives of Appalachians as either "simple and
      stupid" or "dirty and dangerous." This dissertation cross-connects
      the politics and poetics of southern Appalachian coal mining culture by asking: How is
      Appalachian coal mining culture in southwest Virginia performed as an intimate relationship
      with the body of the mines (or, the "mines-body")? I first ground the reader
      in the context of southern Appalachian cultural history, an abject and Othered region I figure
      as a postcolonial space. I then investigate miners' unique understanding of the mines as
      having a living body, character, and language. This configuration of mining space as a body is
      central to miners' conceptions of their work, the ways they negotiate and construct their own
      identities in relation to the mines, how they cope with the daily dangers of their work, and
      how they later deal with disability as separation from a community of other miners and from
      the mines with which they have formed a sustained relationship. The dissertation highlights
      women miners' narratives of subjugation, sexual harassment, and empowerment, in addition to
      the often silenced narratives of disabled miners with black lung who literally have no breath
      with which to speak against those who unjustly deny them compensation or disability status. iv
      My research culminated in the original live performance Out of the Dark: The Oral Histories of
      Appalachian Coal Miners (DVD archive included). I conclude with reflections on the
      collaborative process and impact of this embodied performance as scholarship and activism.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Seeking to move beyond de-politicized "diversity" discourse, a
      seasoned group of antiracist organizers and a nascent collective of antiracist
      "helping professionals" are collaborating to problematize and transform
      power relations in the domain of social work. This thesis is an ethnographic analysis of the
      training workshops that serve as foundation and threshold to this budding social movement.
      Through participant observation and semi-structured interviews, this study examines the
      co-/reproduction of knowledge-practices through which organizers work with and on participants
      to remake them into antiracist subjects. Moreover, it considers the ways that workshop
      participants strategically and inadvertently appropriate and mediate the knowledge-practices
      of antiracist subject-making in light of intervening knowledges, relations, and experiences.
      This project thus reveals that participants engage in unpredictable ways in their own
      subjectification with and against organizers' intentions and that the (dis)junctures between
      organizers' subjectmaking efforts and participants' "self-making" have
      important and unexpected consequences for this movement of professionals-cum-activists.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation addresses the historical role played by
      "sacrifice" in shaping conceptions of the self, society and history. It
      traces a genealogy of "sacrificial rhetoric" that begins with the Christian
      reconfiguration of the pagan ritual both doctrinally (through the Crucifixion and Eucharist)
      and practically (through ascetic substitutions like chastity, poverty, and obedience). In
      contrast to sacrifice in ancient and indigenous cultures, where the destruction of life or
      wealth ritually enacts a hierarchy of values (the lower is sacrificed to the higher, the gift
      to the source, the creature to the creator), Christian "sacrifice" became
      less a matter of ritual than of discourse. To develop the heuristic resources of
      "sacrificial rhetoric" as a comparative, critical concept, an introductory
      chapter situates this rhetorical analysis in relation to the treatment of sacrifice in social
      scientific discourses. This chapter also relates sacrifice to gift, theft, and exchange,
      elaborates seven "axes of variation" to compare sacrificial variations
      across cultures and through history, and isolates two primary discursive effects of
      sacrificial rhetoric, disaggregation and consecration. Individual chapters examine how the
      pivotal German writers Luther, Hegel, and Weber continue the Christian process of sacrificial
      transformation as they strategically deployed the term to demarcate both between sacred and
      profane and between self and other. At critical junctures "sacrificial
      rhetoric" allowed each of these writers to break with modes of subjectivity defined
      by the ancient allegiance to the polis, or the medieval bonds of fealty, in favor of a subject
      of the modern nation-state defined in relation to worship, reflection, and labor.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper examines the association between a mutual fund manager's personal fund
      investment and mutual fund performance. Newly-released managerial ownership disclosures reveal
      that fund ownership varies across mutual fund managers and, in many instances, is quite large.
      I find that mutual fund returns are increasing in the level of managerial fund investment,
      consistent with managerial ownership realigning decision-maker and shareholder interests. Also
      consistent with the reduction of agency costs, I find that managerial ownership is inversely
      related to fund turnover, which could affect both tax and trading costs. However, I do not
      find any association between portfolio manager ownership and a mutual fund's tax burden.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Six studies were conducted to determine if, to what degree, and why distress occurs
      when a psychologically or a physically close, rather than distant, other is rewarded over
      oneself. It was hypothesized that increased proximity results in greater distress because we
      tend to see ourselves as similar to close others, particularly psychologically close others,
      and because proximity, either spatial or emotional, increases expectations of future
      interactions in which we will be reminded of the benefit to other. Three exploratory studies
      that manipulated physical and psychological closeness and three refined studies that included
      manipulations of similarity or future interactions revealed that benefits to another who is
      psychologically or physically proximal are equally distressing, but the mediators of distress
      differ. There are clear paths from perceived similarity to perceived injustice to distress
      when a psychologically close other is benefited relative to oneself. When a physically close
      other is benefited, distress is mediated by expected reminders of other's benefit rather than
      perceived similarity and perceived injustice.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The dissertation examines the welfare state and labour market reforms under social
      democratic governments in nine OECD countries across three main types of welfare state regimes
      after the Golden Age. Using a "most-different-cases" comparative research
      design, the dissertation makes four main contributions to the literature. First, it proposes a
      theoretical framework for social democratic welfare reforms. As an
      "activation" based approach to social justice, the core third way strategies
      are focused on the expansion of active labour market measures. Secondly, the dissertation
      contests the "new politics of the welfare state" thesis that path dependency
      diminishes partisan effects on welfare reforms after the Golden Age. Thirdly, the dissertation
      argues that focusing solely on the welfare state proper, and social expenditure in particular,
      is inappropriate for welfare reform studies. Lastly, with regard to theories of institutional
      evolution, the dissertation highlights the importance of institutional innovation based on
      political contestation, as opposed to institutional reproduction based on path dependency.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper examines the information content of internal controls legislation, as
      mandated by Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. I draw on two conventional
      measures of information content – stock return volatility and trading volume – and find that
      these two measures exhibit a statistically larger event period reaction to firms’ initial
      material weakness disclosures relative to an adjacent non-event period and to a matched sample
      of control firms. In the multivariate setting, I find a significant, positive relation between
      the material weakness variable and both information content measures after controlling for
      multiple other sources of event period news. In an additional test of informativeness, I find
      support for the hypothesis that Section 404 disclosures are incrementally informative to the
      initial Section 302 disclosures. Collectively, the evidence suggests that investors respond to
      the information contained in material weakness disclosures, consistent with these disclosures
      providing an additional piece of value-relevant news for investors to consider in making
      resource allocation decisions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This project identifies and explains the major rhetorical strategies American poets
      from Vietnam to the present use to create political poems. It argues that there are many
      different, though overlapping, approaches to making sociopolitically engaged poetry.
      Understanding political poetry as a collection of multiple rhetorical strategies moves away
      from identitybased and subject-based criticism. This project thus considers a number of
      representative poems from each strategy in order to illuminate each strategy's intricacies.
      Further, the contention that hip hop has the most political potential of contemporary poetries
      suggests convergences with strategies for making printed poetry political. The framework for
      understanding both hip hop and printed poetry is derived from theories of agency that
      negotiate the individual's ability to act according to her purposes in relation to the
      determining economic, political, and social forces that constrain action. The strategies
      considered thus emerge from various types of poetic agency: embodied agency, including both
      experiential and authoritative agency; equivocal agency, including comprehensive and
      particular varieties; migratory agency; and contestatory urban agency, which includes
      strategies indigenous to hip hop. Poems of embodied agency utilize the lived experiences of
      speaker-poets, experiences transformed through poetry but demonstrable through the body and
      memory. While poems of authoritative agency present individual and collective experience, they
      insist that they know the conditions of others and demand action from their readers. Poems of
      equivocal agency problematize notions of direct experience and are often nearly devoid of
      human presence, but replete with equivocation, irony, satire, and transpersonal experiences.
      The primary source of agency in poems of migratory agency is the fluid border between English-
      and Spanishspeaking cultures in the Americas. Their bilingual textures contest English's role
      as the language for poetic, social, and political expression in the United States. The final
      chapter expands the scope for contemporary American political poetry, arguing that hip hop can
      achieve politically what printed poetry cannot. Live hip hop shows at small clubs can create
      interactive, community-based, democratic spaces, and hip hop's internal debates about
      authenticity and agency vivify the culture, ensure its diversity, and work to uphold its
      endangered emphasis on collective identity and community strength.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper attempts to understand the trajectories of adolescent depression and
      gender/racial disparities. I conduct data analysis using data from the National Longitudinal
      Survey of Adolescent Health. I use growth curve models that trace individual depression
      trajectories over different ages employing a measurement that is comparable across
      gender/race. I find that depression increases at early adolescence and decreases at late
      adolescence. This pattern is consistently found among both males and females. Females are
      found to be significantly disadvantaged in depression when compared to males for all races.
      Racial disparity, unclear in previous literature, is clarified in this study. Minority groups
      do encounter greater levels of depression, ad compared to their white counterparts, female
      minorities face greater disadvantages compared to male minorities. However, in spite of gender
      and racial gaps, after the respondents enter their 20s, the disparities are greatly reduced,
      as the depression overall has decreased for all groups.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation adopts a postmodernist approach to explore the different types of
      transgression-the violating, breaking, surpassing, or criticizing of the dominant culture-in
      six representative Spanish novels and films produced at the end of the twentieth-century in
      Spain: Una mala noche la tiene cualquiera, by Eduardo Mendicutti; Las edades de Lulú, by
      Almudena Grandes; Historias del Kronen, by José Angel Mañas; Amor, curiosidad, prozac y dudas,
      by Lucía Etxebarría; Todo sobre mi madre, by Pedro Almodóvar; and Solas, by Benito Zambrano.
      The project concentrates on four ways in which the cultural and hegemonic values and
      traditions of Post-Franco Spanish society undergo narrativized disruption: transgressions
      against the older generations, against the traditional nuclear family, against conventional
      forms of sexuality, and against the body of the past. In this study I show not only how these
      transgressive discourses work to destabilize oppressive critical, political, social, and
      gender categories within mainstream Spanish society but also how certain contradictions,
      ambiguities, and paradoxes inhere in these transgressive attempts. In this sense, the main
      objective of this study is to problematize the concept of transgression in contemporary
      Spanish culture and society, questioning the binary dichotomy between order and transgression,
      and emphasizing the dynamism and interaction between both terms. The dissertation considers
      the difficulty if not impossibility of radical subversion in the Spanish postmodern context
      and attempts to clarify the ambiguity and paradox that characterize the multiple
      transgressions found in these texts. This study problematizes the reading of texts that in a
      sense rebel against the entrenched normative legacy of the Spanish dictatorship at the end of
      the Millenium, destabilizing some of the 'normative' values of society, and tries to make more
      evident the great potential of the transgressive discourses found in these narrative and
      cinematic productions. In their paradoxical formulations, they celebrate difference itself and
      speak the voices traditionally silenced.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Actions of political party elites are central to many theories of new issue alignment
      in mass electorates. But these theories seemingly have little to say about the mass party
      implications of the most important recent development in American party politics: elite party
      polarization along the existing dimension of conflict over the scope of the federal government
      and its role in providing social services. This project addresses the impact of elite
      polarization on mass party change in the United States, paying particular attention to how
      changes in the political context affect the decision-making processes of individual citizens.
      Chapter 1 develops an equilibrium theory of mass-elite linkages, showing that mass parties
      have polarized on the existing dimension and that mass and elite polarization are linked in a
      systematic way. Chapter 2 explores the impact of this mass polarization for changes in the
      relative size of party coalitions. The chapter develops a theory of macro-micro linkages in
      the party system, explaining how macro-context and individual-level behavior interact to
      produce aggregate-level change. The analysis shows that the Democratic Party has become
      smaller not because of a decline in the importance of social class or the growing prominence
      of "cultural" concerns, but rather because polarization-and the resultant
      clarity of elite positions-has caused many citizens with conservative scope-of-government
      preferences to become Republicans. Chapter 3 addresses the impact of polarization on electoral
      decision-making, exploring the relationship between partisanship-policy preference consistency
      and the decision to cast a party-line vote. I find that, dependent on certain attributes of
      the individual and context, individuals whose policy preferences are broadly consistent with
      those of their party's elites are more likely to vote for candidates of their party. Recent
      increases in the number of "consistent" citizens, brought about in large
      part by elite polarization, explain the resurgence of party voting in the electorate. Taken
      together, these chapters suggest that scope-of-government issues play a larger role than any
      time in recent history in defining the mass party system. They also provide a framework for
      thinking about the dynamic relationships between context, citizens, and political outcomes.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation examines the impact of a realistic discourse in the XXI century in
      the following four Spanish novels: Soldados de Salamina, La noche de los cuatro caminos: una
      historia de maquis. Madrid, 1945, La voz dormida, and Sefarad: una novela de novelas. These
      novels use textual documentation to redirect fiction toward an ethical and moral compromise
      with the repressed historical past, striving to overcome the amnesia of the Spanish
      imagination and the relativism and indifference of narrative in previous decades. At the same
      time, these texts are also a testimony of the impossibility of attaining such goal. The
      introduction examines the various narrative, rhetorical, and theoretical discourses, exploring
      the realistic aesthetics of these texts and the intimate relationship of history, literature,
      and memory through the lens of Baudrillard, Hutcheon, Bakhtin, and Derrida. The first part of
      the dissertation is devoted to the analysis of Soldados, La noche de los Cuatro Caminos: una
      historia del maquis. Madrid, 1945, and La voz dormida. In Soldados and La noche simulation is
      employed to erase the frontier between reality and representation. The novels undertake a
      rhetorical game of investigation, suspense and intrigue to inquire into the historical past.
      The analysis further explores the role of autobiography and self-conscious writing. My
      analysis of La voz dormida also delves into the role of women in the writing of historical
      narratives. The second part of the dissertation is devoted to Sefarad: una novela de novelas.
      Sefarad also participates in the same autobiographical, intertextual and metafictional play
      used by Cercas and Trapiello. Moreover, Muñoz Molina uses rhetorical games to recuperate and
      retain formerly underrepresented and repressed voices in history. I conclude by acknowledging
      the impossibility of these texts overcoming certain issues of representation and the always
      problematic relationship of history, literature, and memory. However, these four novels not
      only make obvious the role of historical memory in reconstructing the past, but represent in
      themselves "lieux de mémoire," that is, valid commemorative spaces that
      rethink and confront the past in the historical present of Spain.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Pre-service teachers enter teacher education programs with a working practical theory
      formed from personal experience, knowledge and values. By engaging in reflective thinking,
      pre-service teachers reaffirm, reassess and recreate the practical theory that guides their
      actions and beliefs on teaching and learning. Weblogs, an emerging technology in teacher
      education, offer a new medium for reflective practice. This dissertation explores the
      tripartite elements of practical theory, reflective practice and weblogs as explored through a
      qualitative research study conducted in a secondary MAT program at a large southeastern
      university. Through the qualitative content analysis of weblog postings, focus group
      interviews and individual interviews, a grounded theory emerged to support weblogs as a forum
      for informal reflection. The research undertaken in this qualitative study reveals the
      positive potential of weblogs in pre-service teachers' reflective practice. The informality of
      weblogs, their accessibility through the Internet and their ability to support communal
      interactions on-line are positive features of weblogs. These features, in turn, support
      informal reflection, a component of reflective practice produced by the interaction of
      practical theory, flexible structure, personal expression and communal interaction. Informal
      reflection is not a substitute for the formal, hierarchical (and necessary) reflection
      frequently found in teacher education but a facet of the reflective process that, with further
      study, may prove to be a valuable component of reflective practice for preservice and
      practicing teachers.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Materials scientists have embraced nanoscale materials as allowing new degrees of
      freedom in materials design, as well as producing completely new and enhanced properties
      compared with conventional materials. However, most nanofabrication methods are tedious and
      expensive, or require extreme conditions. This thesis presents efficient methods for
      generating nanostructured materials under relatively mild chemistry and experimental
      conditions. The basis of most of this work is porous anodic aluminum oxide (p-AAO) membranes,
      which have hexagonally close-packed pores and were fabricated following a two-step aluminum
      anodization procedure. Partially removing the barrier layer of a p-AAO membrane enabled the
      preparation of silver nanorod arrays using a very simple electrodepostition procedure. One
      dimensional (1-D) alumina nanostructures were also electrochemically synthesized on the
      surface of a p-AAO membrane by carefully controlling the anodization parameters.
      Polyacrylonitrile nanofibers containing platinum salt were fabricated by polymerization of
      acrylonitrile in p-AAO templates. Subsequent pyrolysis resulted in carbon nanofibers wherein
      the platinum salt is reduced in-situ to elemental Pt. The Pt nanoparticles are dispersed
      throughout the carbon nanofibers, have a narrow size range, and are single crystals. Rotating
      disc electrode voltammetry suggests that the dispersion of Pt nanocrystals in the carbon
      nanofiber matrix should exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity. The preparation of
      catalyst ink and the construction of membrane-electrode-assembly need to be optimized to get
      better performance in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. Platinum nanoparticles embedded
      in carbon fibers were also prepared using electrospinning. The prepared platinum nanoparticles
      are narrowly distributed in size and well dispersed in the carbon matrix. This method can
      provide a large yield of products with a simple setup and procedure. 2-D arrays of nanopillars
      made from perfluoropolyether (PFPE) derivatives were fabricated using p-AAO membrane
      templates. Pretexturing the aluminum prior to anodization enables one to engineer multiple
      morphological length scales and thereby synthesize a lotus leaf-like topography. Both
      nanopillars on a flat surface and on a lotus leaflike topology exhibit superhydrophobicity,
      low contact angle hysteresis and self-cleaning.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation explores contemporary cultural politics via the optic of beef
      consumption. Drawing from the work of Michel Foucault, Giorgio Agamben, Bruno Latour and
      Jacques Derrida, I examine the discursive conditions that both normalize and pathologize the
      consumption of animal flesh in terms of what resonates as natural, good or ethical
      consumption, what is considered marginal or fringe, and what is regarded as unethical,
      unnatural or unhealthy. My interest is how discourses surrounding the health and ethics of
      flesh consumption articulate with broader regulatory regimes. I focus on beef because of its
      centrality in North American diets. Beef has recently become the target of health and
      environmental concerns, in part due to the emergence of vegetarianism as well as animal rights
      organizations that are calling contemporary agricultural and gastronomic practices into
      question. Beef is also a salient trade and political issue with recent outbreaks of bovine
      spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease), a fatal disease that can cross the species divide
      from cattle to humans via flesh consumption. I propose that underlying the contemporary
      politics of beef consumption are deeper struggles over the nature of the divide separating
      humans from animals as well as culture from nature. These boundaries are continuously
      constructed, maintained and challenged by our beliefs about and accepted practices of flesh
      consumption (who or what we deem acceptable to eat). They are bound up in the ways in which we
      categorize eating practices (herbivores, carnivores, vegetarians) and how we respond when
      these categories are transgressed. To conclude, I explore alternative ways of conceiving an
      ethics of flesh consumption, one that takes into account our often troubled relations with
      animal bodies. Following the work of Jacques Derrida, I propose that such an ethics be framed
      in terms hospitality and conviviality: we never eat entirely on our own because we are
      inherently in relation with other beings and situated within particular environments, both
      material and symbolic. This acknowledges and respects the boundaries imposed by the
      particularities, contingencies and contradictions so intimately bound up with our need to
      consume other bodies as well as other bodies that need to consume.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Obtaining stable and uniform alignment of liquid crystals on a macroscopic scale is
      essential for the fabrication and operation of high-quality liquid crystal displays. The
      alignment layer imposes the proper orientation of the liquid crystals in the initial state.
      Currently, the preferred modification technique is rather primitive: the conductive substrate
      is coated with a polyimide layer that after thermal curing is mechanically rubbed. This
      technique generates dust particles that interfere with display operation and often results in
      irreversible electrostatic damage to the electronic components of the display. Also, the
      details of the alignment mechanisms associated with unidirectional rubbing are not well
      understood. Thus, there is a demand for non-contact alignment techniques that are easily
      reproduced and quanitifed. The work presented in this dissertation focuses on the development
      of novel alignment layers for use in liquid crystal displays, alignment layers that eliminate
      the need for a mechanical rubbing step in the fabrication process. The goal of this research
      was to find a material that could induce spontaneous, uniform alignment by means of easily
      quantified mechanisms. Several types of alignment layers, including surfactant monolayers,
      carbon nanotube and metal-oxide nanorod films and polymer films were examined for possible use
      in liquid crystal displays. Perfluoropolyether films embossed by softiii lithography methods
      with a pattern of parallel grooves induced uniform homeotropic alignment of nematic liquid
      crystals on a macroscopic scale, offering the most promising alternative to traditional
      polyimide alignment layers.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Cyclic integration - the manner in which movements of a multi-movement cycle relate to
      one another - is a compositional device generally associated with music written from the
      nineteenth century onward, beginning with the works of Beethoven. It is most commonly
      perceived to be based primarily (if not exclusively) on thematic resemblances. The use of
      Beethoven's works as a standard for evaluating the practices of other composers, and the
      limited number of compositions by Haydn and Mozart including thematic resemblances, have
      combined to create the perception that Haydn and Mozart ignored cyclic integration in the
      majority of their works. This dissertation argues for a broader conception of cyclic
      integration in the music of Haydn and Mozart by viewing it as a compositional device that can
      extend beyond thematic ideas to incorporate a variety of possible elements. These include
      harmony, texture, form, phrase structure, musical topics, rhythm, articulation, and other
      musical elements. An analysis of Mozart's String Quartet in A major, K. 464, serves as a case
      study in demonstrating a methodology for eighteenth-century cyclic integration. A broad survey
      of their practices from c. 1770-c. 1800 evaluates the extent of their use of cyclic
      integration as a compositional device. The results of this survey indicate that Haydn and
      Mozart reserve their strongest connections for symphonies and string quartets, and that their
      practices changed over the course of time.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>High-resolution infrared spectroscopy has been used to study various metal cluster-HCN
      systems solvated in superfluid helium nanodroplets. The metal clusters include magnesium,
      zinc, copper and silver. The weakly interacting nature of the helium droplets allowed for the
      free rotation of molecules solvated within them and, as a result, full rotationally resolved
      infrared spectra were acquired. The ro-vibrational spectra was used, along with extensive ab
      initio calculations, to determine the structures of the metal-HCN complexes. Through the
      application of moderate electric fields to the laser interaction region, we also were able to
      measure accurate dipole moments, giving further information about the nature of the
      interaction between adsorbate and metal cluster.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Retroviruses selectively package two sense-strand viral genomic RNAs that are
      noncovalently linked at their 5' ends to form a complex, but structurally unresolved dimer.
      Determining the molecular basis for dimerization is an initial step in understanding the role
      of this dimer in retroviral biology and also in devising novel anti-viral and retroviral
      vector therapies. Initially, I define a 170-nucleotide Minimal Dimerization Active Sequence
      (MiDAS) for a representative gamma retrovirus, the Moloney murine sarcoma virus, by stringent
      competitive dimerization. I then analyze, at single-nucleotide resolution, the secondary
      structure of the MiDAS monomer and final dimer states using quantitative Selective 2'-Hydroxyl
      Acylation and Primer Extension (SHAPE) chemistry. SHAPE analysis characterizes two novel
      structural features within the monomer and dimer states. Both the monomer and dimer contain
      partially overlapping, but distinct flexible domains spanning 63 and 58 nucleotides,
      respectively. (ii) The well conserved SL1-SL2 domain that consists of two GACG-containing stem
      loop structures undergoes a modest conformational RNA switch in which SL1 is extended by four
      base-pairs. I then analyze the structural implications of both SL1-SL2 conformations and
      identify that this domain can mediate iv specific interactions between RNA strands in the
      final dimer by a two-step mechanism. Finally, using site-directed and solvent-based hydroxyl
      radical footprinting, I show that the MiDAS final dimer adopts a compact three-dimensional
      structure containing multiple longrange tertiary interactions. Moreover, within the dimer, the
      SL1-SL2 domain folds autonomously into a tertiary U-shaped structure stabilized by
      interdigitated interactions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The predominance of trivial themes and stereotypical characters represented in most of
      the plays performed in the commercial theatre of the decades of the twenties, thirties and
      forties in Spain and Argentina determined that they would be pejoratively described as of
      "low quality." Some critics have even talked about a "crisis in
      theater." Both nations responded to this "perceived crisis" in
      similar fashion, mostly by developing groups of "Independent Theater," and
      staging plays by innovative directors and new and original playwrights. This dissertation
      studies the ways in which the theater of Spain and Argentina responded to their precarious
      drama situation and analyzes the similar ways on which they contributed to the improvement of
      their own national theaters. The first chapter examines the socio-historical situation in
      Spain and Argentina and how it affected the stage. I discuss the "crisis in
      theater" in both nations and their connections concerning companies, actors, writers
      and critics. The second chapter focuses on the "Independent Theater" that
      emerged in these two countries and that shared the pedagogical objective of educating the
      taste of the audience. I specifically focus on the parallelisms between two of these groups,
      one on each side of the Atlantic, which share the name "Teatro del Pueblo."
      The analysis of parallelism between two plays--La sirena varada (1934) by the Spaniard
      Alejandro Casona and La cola de la sirena (1941) by the Argentinean Conrado Nalé Roxlo--is the
      topic of my third chapter. I consider these plays representatives not only of the new wave of
      authors but also of the theatrical interconnections between the two countries. This
      transatlantic study foregrounds the complex relationships between the stages of Argentina and
      Spain during the fist half of the century, and problematizes the lack of interaction between
      both stages promoted by previous criticism.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study connects the domestic novel's period of extraordinary success, from
      approximately 1845 to 1865, to the legal developments of the early nineteenth century. During
      this period, both discourses responded to the volatile antebellum economy by endorsing women's
      removal from the marketplace. In order to limit speculation and create stability, legal
      rhetoric and literary narratives alike idealized marriage as a status, or hierarchical,
      relationship, even as other relationships were rewritten in contractual terms. Within the
      context of the project, then, fiction takes on a double meaning. While legal discourse
      circulated "legal fictions"-rhetorical structures that shaped people's
      discussions of marriage-domestic novels envisioned the range of possibilities for women even
      within the confines of an inferior legal status. "Troubling Women" traces
      the domestic novel's development in tandem with legislative debates and judicial decisions,
      elucidating why these discourses resisted domestic contracts and promoted status and
      protectionism. It begins with a historical overview, followed by an examination of James
      Fenimore Cooper's The Pioneers-a prototypical domestic plot in which an heiress's right
      marriage restores the "natural aristocracy." Focusing on narratives of the
      1850s and 1860s by a range of authors-including Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, E.D.E.N.
      Southworth, Caroline Lee Hentz, Frank J. Webb, and Harriet Jacobs-the project illustrates how,
      in the intervening decades of increasing market dominance, Cooper's proposed solution had
      become untenable. Like Cooper's novel, these texts endorse women's inferior legal status, but
      they also illustrate that women's relationship to property had become an unsettled and
      contested question. The project concludes with an exploration of Elizabeth Stoddard's novels
      from the 1860s, which highlight the profound costs of idealizing women's legal inferiority, an
      increasingly indefensible construction in the wake of emancipation. Grounded in historical
      detail, this project demonstrates how the domestic novel defused the culture's fear of the
      market by reimagining women's relationship to property. By detailing domestic novels' complex
      engagements with legal discourse, "Troubling Women" rejects the persistent
      claims that these texts either unconsciously reflected or actively subverted conservative
      ideologies; instead it underscores the range of the genre's political commitments.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation reports the development of a method to achieve continuous production
      of carbon nanotubes. The as produced carbon nanotubes were purified and further processed to
      tune their properties. Then dielectrophoresis as a versatile technique was used to manipulate
      and assemble carbon nanotubes into functional structures. In the processing part, purified
      carbon nanotubes are treated with strong acid then annealed at different temperatures.
      Combined TEM and NMR studies show that tips of SWNTs in bulk quantities can be uniformly
      opened by oxidation and closed by vacuum annealing at a surprisingly low temperature. The
      results provide a guideline on how the SWNTs should be processed for potential energy storage
      applications. In the assembly part, first, the results of a systematic study on the
      interactions of CNTs suspended in media of various viscosities and ionic conductivities with
      an AC field of different frequencies were reported. Then the feasibility of utilizing the
      dielectrophoresis for controlled assembling of functional CNT structures was explored.
      Finally, the automated process of assembling CNT fibrils unto sharp probes was realized and a
      precise control over the process was especially studied.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Microtubules (MTs) are required for nuclear movements and chromosome segregation. MTs
      are polymers of tubulin protein with a defined polarity - the minus end is associated with the
      microtubule organizing center (MTOC) whereas the plus end probes the cellular environment.
      Additional proteins associated with the plus end act as adaptors between the MT and binding
      sites that facilitate nuclear and chromosome movements. The budding yeast Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae was used as a model system to examine two questions: (1) During mitotic spindle
      elongation, how does the cell ensure each daughter inherits a single MTOC? To investigate
      this, Mitotic Exit Network (MEN) proteins were analyzed in living cells. I find that, after
      anaphase onset, the MEN activator Tem1p accumulates persistently on the MTOC that enters the
      daughter cell. In contrast, the abundance of the MEN inhibitor Bub2p decreases during
      anaphase. This suggests that after anaphase onset, the presence of one MTOC in the daughter
      cell persistently signals mitotic exit. (2) By what mechanism do plus end binding proteins
      link oppositely oriented MT arrays? In the budding yeast mating pathway, the translocation of
      haploid nuclei toward each other is known as nuclear congression. I find nuclear congression
      is driven by MT plus end interactions. The plus end binding proteins Kar3p and Bik1p are
      required for efficient MT- MT interactions. Additionally, I find that during mitosis in
      vegetative cells, Kar3p and Bik1p are part of a family of plus end binding proteins that are
      required for anti-parallel MT interactions. Taken together, these data suggest a specific
      subset of plus end binding proteins function similarly during mating and mitosis on oppositely
      oriented MT arrays.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Duke Ellington's world music suite the Afro-Eurasian Eclipse (1970) has been
      relatively overlooked in the community of jazz scholarship. This may be due to the
      historiographical contexts that privilege Ellington as a composer of art music or Ellington as
      a champion of black cultural awareness vis-à-vis his more famous musico-political works such
      as the Black and Tan Fantasy (1933) and the Black Brown, and Beige suite (1943). Closer
      investigation reveals that an increasingly active political climate and growing awareness of
      globalization in the later 1960s combined with Ellington's travels and personal experiences to
      inspire him to adopt a more transnational attitude about music and culture. The genesis and
      musical content of the Afro-Eurasian Eclipse demonstate that Ellington's expression of musical
      identity and his role in the jazz community had changed from the early years. Accordingly,
      scholars should reformulate the historiographical constructs to accommodate Ellington's later
      engagement with world music.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In the drive for smaller image sizes in microelectronic devices, the lithography
      industry has reached a point where the solvents traditionally used for development are
      potentially damaging to the images formed. The use of a more gentle solvent, such as
      supercritical carbon dioxide, has been shown to alleviate this problem. Furthermore,
      replacement of the solvents in spin-coating and stripping with condensed CO2 could streamline
      the lithography process as the "wet" solvents would be eliminated. Also, CO2
      is an environmentally benign and easily recyclable alternative to the solvents currently used
      in microlithography for the solvent-intensive steps of processing a photoresist. As next
      generations of lithographic techniques for imaging a photoresist approach, more stringent
      requirements are placed on the resist. For 193 nm and 193 nm immersion resists, alicyclic
      backbones have been shown to impart etch resistance and to elevate glass transition
      temperatures, while fluorination has been shown to decrease absorbance. As an additional
      advantage for processing in CO2, fluorination also increases CO2 solubility. Various
      norbornene-based monomers were synthesized to include fluorinated moieties. Resist materials
      were synthesized by addition polymerization using allylpalladium chloride dimer. Fluorinated
      copolymers containing a "chemical switch" have been found to have a
      significant CO2 solubility difference, as well as a difference in intrinsic viscosities. Dry
      plasma etching of these polymers has demonstrated moderate etch resistance compared to
      Novolac. Imaging with an ASML 193 nm scanner has resolved 1 micrometer semidense lines, using
      CO2 as the developer.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The digital literacy revolution compels first-year writing programs (FYWPs) to expand
      their definitions of writing to include multimodal composition and their teaching practices to
      account for technology. Such expansions challenge the traditional role and approach of FYWPs
      in preparing students for prose writing in the academy. This dissertation explores a rationale
      and process for change that moves FYWPs toward an e-literacies agenda-one that attends to the
      ways in which technology mediates classroom spaces and writing. The project is a mixed-genre
      approach to four dilemmas posed by an e-literacies agenda: (a) changing a FYWP in response to
      a new idea about literacy; (b) responding to critiques that multimodal composition is not
      adequate preparation for academic discourse; (c) incorporating media and design into a
      conceptual understanding of the rhetorical situation; and (d) accounting for instructional
      technologies in writing course design. Chapter 2 uses a case study methodology to analyze
      earlier paradigm shifts in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Writing Program.
      It extrapolates seven impact points that show how theory affects practice in writing program
      design. The remaining chapters engage these impact points, albeit by situating the discussion
      in a narrower context than writing program design. Chapter 3 emphasizes the pedagogical
      principles underlying the teaching of academic discourse and also facilitating multimodal
      composition. Chapter 4 proposes a new model of the rhetorical triangle, providing a set of
      terms and relationships that enable instructors with little visual literacy expertise to
      introduce media and design effectively. Chapter 5 argues for an ecological perspective of
      course design that better integrates the discourse of writing pedagogy with the best practices
      of teaching with technology. The conclusion deliberates about how the e-literacies agenda
      anticipated by these conceptual frameworks challenges a FYWP's university service role. By
      insisting that FYWPs occupy a prime institutional location for preparing students to read and
      compose the printed page and the electronic screen, the conclusion argues that larger
      commitments to literacy-not just college writing-are most appropriate for required composition
      courses.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study investigates the relationship of sixteenth-century Italian debates over
      romances of chivalry to Cervantes's Don Quixote. It argues that Cervantes's novel is a
      literary installment to the debate and that the novel makes use of imitation and genre-bending
      to achieve its objective of asserting pleasure as the primary theoretical criterion. Torquato
      Tasso's discourses are examined in opposition to Cervantes's novel, and similarities between
      them are explored.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study investigated the temporal relationship between pain and sleep in children
      with sickle cell disease (SCD) and examined the influence of additional stressors and pain
      medication practices on this relationship. To accomplish the goals of the study, 20 children
      with SCD aged 8 to 12 years of age completed daily diaries for approximately 5 weeks. These
      diaries were analyzed using multilevel models. Results were consistent with the hypothesis
      that there is a cyclic relationship between high SCD pain and poor sleep. Specifically, high
      levels of daily SCD pain were significantly related to poor sleep quality that night. Also,
      poor sleep quality during the night was significantly related to high SCD pain that day. Poor
      sleep quality appeared to be the stronger predictor in the pain-sleep cycle. Additional
      stressors and pain medication use did not evidence a substantial impact on the relationship
      between SCD pain and sleep, but instead evidenced more direct influences on SCD pain and sleep
      aspects. Clinical and policy implications include the possible benefits of raising awareness
      among clinicians, policymakers, patients, and their parents about the interaction between the
      child's symptoms and sleep patterns. Additional research should study how other disease
      symptoms may influence sleep and how sleep may influence other disease symptoms. In addition,
      this research should examine the role of disease management strategies implemented by the
      child and his/her family on these relationships.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The evolution of animal behavior is, in part, a reflection of the evolution of the
      nervous system. In the search for general principles of how neural circuits evolve, a
      fundamental question is whether certain elements of nervous systems tend to be conserved
      whereas others are evolutionarily labile. Nudibranch molluscs are ideal for comparative
      studies of neural circuits because the sea slugs, as a group, show morphological and
      behavioral diversity yet possess a relatively simple nervous system. The species Tritonia
      diomedea has been used as a model organism to understand the neural basis of various
      behavioral patterns, including the neural basis of mucociliary crawling. Mucociliary crawling
      is the primary mode of locomotion by the nudibranchs, although muscular crawling has been
      observed in at least two species. In addition to this behavioral variation, the nudibranchs
      also have variation in foot morphology. To determine whether there are aspects of the
      nudibranch nervous system that are correlated with behavior or morphology, the neural circuit
      underlying crawling was examined in a number of nudibranch species. The central nervous system
      of T. diomedea has two pairs of ciliary motor neurons that produce TPeps, a group of
      cilio-exitatory neuropeptides. T. diomedea also has an extensive network of TPep-immuoreactive
      neurites at the base of the pedal epithelium. A similar network of TPep-like immunoreactivity
      was found at the pedal epithelium of all nudibranchs examined. This feature was also seen in
      several non-nudibranch species, indicating that the TPep-based cilio-excitatory system may be
      a general feature of the gastropods. Additionally, neurons homologous to the T. diomedea
      ciliary motor neurons were found in all nudibranchs examined. Differences in the size of
      ciliary motor neurons between species were not obviously correlated with crawling behavior or
      foot morphology. There was a significant correlation between the number of cells and the ratio
      of the length of the foot to the width of the foot. Species with a relatively wide foot tended
      to have more large TPep-LIR cells than species with a long, narrow foot. Changes in cell
      number may be a common trend in how the nervous system evolves to match morphological changes.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In "Persons and Punishment" Herbert Morris defends a retributivist
      theory of the justification of punishment which revives the broadly Kantian tradition of
      arguing for the legitimacy of legal institutions that respect the members of a given moral
      community as persons. Morris' theory uses the normative relationship between free and equal
      people as the source of constraints on just institutions of punishment. However, the benefits
      and burdens model he employs to make sense of how these institutions maintain and respect the
      normative status of persons is subject to question. I will argue that Joel Feinberg's
      expressive function of punishment is compatible with the broadly Kantian justification of
      punishment and can be used to explain the nature of and constraints on just legal and penal
      institutions in place of Morris' benefits and burdens model.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in the quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer has
      become a standard practice for the structural elucidation of peptides for proteomics research.
      In the quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer, MS/MS is commonly effected using collision
      induced dissociation (CID). However, other methods of ion activation, such as infrared
      multi-photon photodissociation (IRMPD) have been used to dissociate parent ions in the
      quadrupole ion trap. The process of MS/MS has several limitations resulting from the operation
      of the quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. Two of these limitations are addressed in the
      research reported in this dissertation. The first limitation addressed in this research is the
      loss of structural information resulting from product ions not trapped during the process of
      CID. During CID in the quadrupole ion trap, product ions with a mass-to-charge approximately
      one-fourth that of their parent ion's mass-to-charge are not trapped for mass analysis. A
      method of MS/MS termed High Amplitude Short Time Excitation (HASTE) CID has been developed to
      allow trapping of these lower massto- charge product ions. This method increases the
      structural elucidation of peptides by providing valuable information in the form of immonium
      ions that are not mass analyzed using conventional CID methods. The second limitation to MS/MS
      addressed in this dissertation is that of dissociating multiple parent ions simultaneously. A
      method termed Iterative Accumulation Multiplexing (IAM) has been developed to increase the
      number of ions that can be identified during a single activation event. Using IAM, more than
      two parent ions can be simultaneously encoded, dissociated, and their resulting product ions
      identified from a ratiogram. Previous experiments conducted using IAM with CID were limited to
      a narrow range of qz values for the parent ions. However, other MS/MS techniques such as
      thermally assisted (TA) CID, IRMPD, and TA-IRMPD, the range of qz values at which a parent ion
      can be successfully activated during IAM is shown to increase. The increased range of qz
      values allow more product ions to be identified from the ratiogram, resulting in greater
      structural elucidation for the peptide parent ions</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>David Foster Wallace's novel Infinite Jest includes an allusion to Dante's Divina
      Commedia that points the reader back to Dante's opening lines of Inferno. Dante's Commedia
      provides a framework for Wallace's own novel in that the allusion is not only an indication of
      Wallace's attempt to place himself with Dante in the literary category of the encyclopedic
      novel, but also a reminder to the reader of Infinite Jest's circular narrative structure. This
      structure, which Wallace borrows from Dante, relies on the resolution of the narrative
      embedded in the beginning sections. Wallace's gestures toward the medieval text serve as an
      ironic reinterpretation of stable allegory and they introduce the promise of truth only to
      disprove it later. In place of Dante's four-fold allegory, Wallace allows his characters to
      believe in the inherent stability of mathematics and the recovery methods of Alcoholics
      Anonymous but he ultimately undercut's the reliability of these systems.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The objective of this study was to determine if clinical measures of flexibility,
      range of motion and strength were different between people with and without Forward Head
      Rounded Shoulder Posture (FHRSP). In this study we measured the flexibility, range of motion,
      and strength of the right arm of twenty two FHRSP and fifteen ideal posture subjects. All
      measures of flexibility and range of motion were measured with a digital inclinometer. Mean
      and peak values (N) of strength were measured with a hand-held dynamometer. There were no
      significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) seen in flexibility, range of motion, or strength
      between groups. The clinical assumptions of FHRSP were not supported in this study using
      common clinical tests. These findings introduce the idea that differences may be in the
      neuromuscular control of the shoulder girdle and not in the actual strength and flexibility of
      muscles and tissue.</mods:abstract>

      Peacocke, and George Bealer which purport to show that there as an indispensable theoretical
      need for a priori knowledge. Bonjour and Peacocke argue that views that deny a priori
      knowledge - which I call Radical Empiricist views - ultimately lead to radical forms of
      skepticism. Bealer argues that Radical Empiricism is incoherent in the sense that it is
      internally inconsistent. In this paper, I evaluate each of these arguments against Radical
      Empiricism and I attempt to show that each is unconvincing. The upshot of my discussion is
      that we have no compelling reason to posit a priori knowledge</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The recent findings of Schilling, Baucom, Burnett, Allen, and Ragland (2003) and
      Baucom, Hahlweg, Engl, Thurmaier, and Schilling (in press) suggest that increasing female
      positive communication or decreasing female negative communication during the Prevention and
      Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP) may increase risk for marital distress among program
      participants. The current investigation re-examines the couples studied by Schilling et al.,
      using ratings on individual communication behaviors, not composite communication scores, to
      predict risk for marital distress in both males and females participating in a weekend version
      of PREP. Results suggest that increasing females' clear and constructive communication,
      decreasing their argument-encouraging behaviors, or decreasing their denial behaviors
      increases risk for distress in PREP participants. Results concerning male individual
      communication behaviors as well as participants' initial risk for marital distress are also
      discussed and new hypotheses regarding the effects of communication change in PREP females on
      risk for marital distress are outlined.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Migration stories appear frequently in Latin American Caribbean and African American
      literatures. Loida Maritza Pérez's Geographies of Home and Erna Brodber's Louisiana are two
      novels that include stories of migration between the Caribbean and the United States.
      Migration and movement offer the female characters in these texts a method of resistance to
      the specific categorizations of gender, race, and nationality. The process of migration
      changes the concept of home as these categories are renegotiated. As the concept of home is
      renegotiated, it becomes more than just a single geographic place. Instead, home is realized
      as many geographic sites and psychological spaces. Geographic and feminist theory offer useful
      perspectives and a powerful lens through which to study these categories in terms of
      resistance.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study was designed to evaluate clinicians' ability to accurately diagnose
      maxillary canine impactions. Simulated cases of maxillary canine impaction were constructed
      using a human skull. Traditional radiographs and NewTom scans were obtained for each simulated
      case. Orthodontists and radiologists viewed and diagnosed the cases using both the traditional
      and NewTom images. The following diagnoses were assessed for each case: 1) Buccopalatal
      location of the canine, 2) Canine proximity to the lateral incisor, and 3) Presence of lateral
      incisor root resorption. Comparisons of diagnostic accuracy were made between the
      orthodontists and radiologists and between the two imaging modalities. For canine
      localization, radiologists outperformed orthodontists using the traditional images, but
      orthodontists' improved dramatically using the NewTom. For proximity and resorption, both
      groups of clinicians were inaccurate using the traditional images, but were significantly more
      accurate using the NewTom. NewTom imaging outperformed traditional radiography for all
      diagnostic questions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of the research project was to determine the number of United States
      (U.S.) dental hygiene (DH) programs having full-time (FT) faculty members who provide direct
      patient care. A pilot-tested questionnaire was placed on Survey Monkey, a survey website.
      Two-hundred and seventy-eight U.S. DH program directors received two E-mails requesting their
      participation. A response rate of 69.1% was achieved and showed that 14.2% of the programs
      required FT faculty members to provide direct patient care while 67.0% of the programs had
      faculty members who participated. The majority (95.4%) of directors indicated maintaining
      clinical skills and current clinical techniques as advantages of faculty participation in
      direct patient care, while 48% of directors indicated participation takes time away from being
      an educator. Overall, the majority of DH programs did not require FT faculty members to
      participate in direct patient care; however, over half of the programs had faculty members who
      participated.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Interest in the timing of first sexual intercourse has increased in recent years
      because of public health, social, and political concerns. Using a life-course theoretical
      perspective, I examined the connection between timing of first sexual intercourse and later
      sexual behavior and health outcomes by analyzing data from Waves I through III of the National
      Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The majority of respondents with a
      current sexual relationship engaged in combinations of various types of sexual behaviors.
      Almost 80% of these respondents included cunnilingus and fellatio as well as vaginal
      intercourse in the sexual repertoire of their current relationship, with over 20% engaging in
      these three sexual activities plus anal sex. Earlier age at first intercourse was associated
      with engaging in oral sex with a current partner for females, and with anal sex with a current
      partner for males and females. Early first intercourse was associated with higher odds of
      testing positive for chlamydial infection, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis among adolescents,
      but the association was not significant among young adults. By young adulthood, an older age
      at first intercourse was no longer protective against these sexually transmitted infections;
      young adults who had started having sex recently had similar levels of sexually transmitted
      infection as those who had been having sex through most of adolescence. Furthermore, timing of
      first intercourse was not associated with sexual coercion victimization or perpetration with a
      current partner. Reports of sexual coercion in current relationships indicated substantial
      levels of male victimization and female perpetration. This work expands upon the current
      understanding of first sexual intercourse and later sexual behavior and health, and carries
      important implications for health promotion education and policy.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is believed to play a
      key role in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated demyelinating disorders of the central nervous
      system by exerting direct deleterious effects on oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of
      the CNS. Increasing evidence predicts that the effect of IFN-gamma on oligodendrocytes in
      culture and in vivo will depend on the developmental stage of the cells and the timing of
      IFN-gamma expression relative to myelination/remyelination. We hypothesize that selected genes
      will be expressed by developmentally different oligodendrocytes when exposed to IFN-gamma. In
      order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms driving these effects, we used microarrays to
      quantitatively compare the transcriptional response of 1) cultured developing and mature
      primary oligodendrocytes exposed to IFN-gamma, and 2) the corpus collosum exposed to IFN-gamma
      in vivo during, and two weeks following, a cuprizone-induced demyelinating insult, measured at
      the point of peak demyelination and at the crest of remyelination. There was a significant
      change in the expression of numerous genes in both the in vitro and in vivo systems as a
      result of IFN-gamma exposure. Most dramatic were changes in the expression of genes involved
      in antigen presentation and protein processing, the immune response, the endoplasmic reticulum
      stress response, apoptosis, and the oxidative stress response. Moreover, immature
      oligodendrocytes appeared more responsive and vulnerable than mature oligodendrocytes to
      IFN-gamma exposure in vitro, and the timing of IFN-gamma induction influenced the
      transcriptional iv response in vivo. Early IFN-gamma exposure demonstrated evidence of a
      deleterious effect, while later IFN-gamma suggested a protective effect, particularly during
      remyelination.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>New Hispanic growth in North Cariolina brought challenging healthcare issues,
      especially to rural areas of NC. The purpose of this study was to collect baseline data
      pertaining to the oral health of Hispanics residing in Siler City, NC, a microcosm of the
      flourishing Latino growth found especially in the southeastern United States. A convenience
      sample of 158 Hispanic adults was recruited. A 41-item Spanish language survey was utilized.
      Multiple choice questions and Likert-type scales addressed preventive oral health practices,
      oral health knowledge and beliefs, perceived needs, and demographic information. Analyses,
      using SAS 9, were conducted to find demographic characteristics, frequencies, and
      correlations. The following associations were found statistically significant (p &lt;
      .05): (1) brushing frequency and belief that healthy gums bleed; (2) dental insurance and
      frequency of dental visits; (3) source of oral hygiene instruction and participant's reported
      brushing or flossing, and dental visit frequency.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Children with cleft palate and velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) often present with
      disorders of articulation, resonance, and phonation. Although limited, previous research has
      shown that children with VPD, as reflected by hypernasality, prolong stop segment durations. A
      respiratory drive hypothesis was proposed to account for these findings. As a test of this
      hypothesis, the current study proposed relationships between velopharyngeal closing time and
      both voice onset time (VOT) and stop gap duration for the phonemes /t/ and /d/. Digital audio
      recordings were obtained from 20 children with cleft palate who produced the syllables
      /tcarrot/ and /dcarrot/. Pressure-flow measurements were used to determine velopharyngeal
      closing durations from the word "hamper." Results indicated a tendency (p
      &gt;.05) for VOT to decrease as velopharyngeal closing time increased. Results also showed
      tendencies for children with alveolar clefts to have different segment durations (p &gt;
      .05). Clinical implications are discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder whose manifestations typically
      fluctuate over time. Prior epidemiologic studies estimate the one-year prevalence as 7-20%,
      depending on criteria used to define IBS. Individuals with IBS demonstrate a high
      co-occurrence with common functional somatic syndromes and psychiatric disorders; however, the
      majority of these associations derive from non-population-based studies. We examined
      associations between IBS risk factors and Rome II-defined IBS in a U.S. population-based twin
      registry. Data from 4,591 male and female twins were available for this analysis. Variables
      representing self-reported presence of IBS, major depressive disorder (MDD), chronic
      widespread pain (CWP), fatiguing illness (CFS-like illness), Medical Outcomes Study short form
      (SF-12) scores and other personal characteristics were obtained through questionnaire. Odds
      ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated as measures of association
      between IBS risk factors and IBS. The prevalence of lifetime IBS was 4.7% (95% CI: 4.1, 5.4).
      Positive associations were observed between IBS and lifetime MDD (OR=2.0, 95% CI: 1.5, 2.7),
      lifetime CWP (OR=3.9, 95% CI: 2.7, 5.5), lifetime CFS-like illness (OR=4.7, 95% CI: 3.0, 7.3),
      and female sex (OR=2.0, 95% CI: 1.4, 2.8). Age, body size, and SF-12 scores demonstrated
      approximately null associations with IBS. We further examined the overlap of individuals with
      IBS and MDD since both disorders suggest a familial tendency and demonstrate a higher than
      expected co-occurrence. Using the population-based Swedish Twin Registry, we examined the
      genetic and environmental architecture of the co-occurrence of IBS and MDD among 31,407 twins
      who contributed information on medical data and personal characteristics via phone interview.
      Both the case-control study and the co-twin control study design demonstrated an increased
      association between MDD and IBS (OR=2.7, 95% CI: 2.3, 3.2), and (OR=2.2, 95% CI, 1.5, 3.2),
      respectively. Thus, genetic and environmental factors did not confound the association between
      MDD and IBS; rather one of these disorders may predispose individuals to the other disorder.
      The positive associations observed between MDD and IBS suggest a possible hypothesis whereby
      one disorder is part of the causal disease mechanism of the other disorder, thereby leading to
      a high co-occurrence between MDD and IBS.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Context: The impact and stress of war extend beyond the military soldier to include
      emotional upheaval for his or her family, yet little is known about how war affects the
      occurrence of child maltreatment in families. This study is the first to use data from a
      national surveillance system to compare child maltreatment in military and non-military
      families. Further, it is the only known study to characterize military perpetrators of child
      maltreatment and to examine the effects of the September 11th, 2001 attacks on the occurrence
      of child maltreatment. Objective: The first objective of this study was to determine if being
      a child in a military family is protective of, or a risk factor for, substantiated child
      maltreatment. The second objective was to assess the impact the attacks of September 11th,
      2001 and the subsequent US military response had on the occurrence of substantiated child
      maltreatment in military families. Methods: This study is a secondary analysis of the National
      Child Abuse and Neglect Data System that incorporates state-level information from the US
      Census Bureau and the Department of Defense to calculate and compare the rates of occurrence
      of substantiated maltreatment in children of military and non-military families. All reports
      of child maltreatment in the state of Texas that received a disposition of substantiation from
      January 1, 2000 through June 30, 2003 were the focus of these analyses. Texas was iv selected
      because of the completeness and quality of its NCANDS data and its large military population.
      Results: The rate of occurrence of substantiated child maltreatment in military families is
      generally lower than that of non-military families. However, the rate doubled when comparing
      the period after October 1, 2002 to the period before. The periods with the highest rates of
      child maltreatment corresponded to intense military operations in Iraq, the highest percentage
      of departures to operational deployments, and the lowest percentage of returns from
      operational deployments. Conclusion: Compared to children of non-military families, children
      of military families generally experienced lower rates of child maltreatment. However, this
      protective effect seemed to disappear when military combat increased and military families
      experienced operation-related deployment.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study seeks to explore the perceptions of senior dental students and junior
      military dental officers regarding their choice of a military career to identify the
      recruitment methodologies that influenced their decisions, and to determine if these
      strategies might suggest ways of increasing recruitment for dental academia. Official
      documentation of activities related to recruitment was requested from the military services.
      In-depth telephone interviews were conducted to gather qualitative data from senior dental
      students and junior military dental officers. The interviews suggest that, although obtaining
      a dental education paid for by military scholarship was a dominant factor, other inducements
      to sign with the military included: guaranteed employment upon graduation; the prestige
      associated with the military; access to post graduate training; minimal practice management
      concerns; and opportunities for continue education. A career in dental education can offer
      similar incentives, and students may choose academia as a career if the incentives are
      emphasized.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study suggests that by the mid-twentieth century, transportation accidents were
      no longer thought to be something that could be eradicated through the eradication of human
      error. Neither were they something to be simply accepted. Instead, they were something to be
      expertly monitored and measured, scrutinized and analyzed, explained and contained. To these
      ends, transportation accidents were subjected to rigorous investigation and controlled
      experiment, and new means and methods were designed and implemented to technologically write,
      scientifically read, and institutionally manage them. Technologies of accident advances three
      basic propositions: (1) the transportation accident was made into an object of scientific and
      institutional analysis, knowledge, and control in the united states during the 1940s and '50s;
      (2) the transportation accident, regarded in the nineteenth century as an impediment to
      technological progress, was reconstituted in the twentieth as a catalyst for technological
      progress; and (3) accident technologies and forensic media such as the flight-data recorder,
      the cockpit-voice recorder, and the high-speed motion-picture camera embodied and enabled the
      twin transformations described in the first two propositions. This study examines the origins
      and implications of a cultural and institutional project driven by two interrelated
      imperatives: discover the transportation accident's "truth" (in the name of
      history or science) and discipline the transportation accident's signification (in the name of
      education). Particular attention is paid to how accident technologies and forensic media
      articulated and were articulated by their cultural and discursive contexts, as well as the
      ways in which they rearticulated earlier technocultural imaginings and practices.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Two main issues were hypothesized to affect the composition and spatial structure of
      land use patterns in Northeast Thailand: land use/land cover (LULC) policies at the national,
      regional, and local levels, and geographic accessibility of villagers to communities and
      associated land territories. The policy analysis employed a documentary-style approach to
      describe the changes in environmental policy and LULC over time in the Northeast. The LULC
      change and road connectivity analysis used a time-series of aerial photography for 1954, 1967,
      1984, and 1994. The photos were scan-digitized into a seamless image database and interpreted
      for the four time periods. Road connectivity was calculated using Alpha and Gamma indices.
      LULC change in spatially-buffered areas were assessed for the all-weather roads for Nang Rong
      district for 1954 and 1984, and pattern metrics were calculated to examine the composition and
      spatial organization of LULC over time and space. Problems of soil quality, land degradation,
      land management, land allocation, and land rights were addressed within the policy analysis.
      Obstacles to their full assessment and management included the lack of consistent
      implementation of LULC policies due to changing governments and alternate land initiatives.
      The connectivity indices showed an increase through time, thereby, indicating that the road
      network was more connected across the image time-series. Further, the indices indicated that
      greater access to land resulted in greater compositional and organizational shifts in LULC
      types. Spatial buffers and ecological pattern metrics indicated that the areas closer to roads
      were deforested earlier and to a greater degree. Also, a greater number of forest patches were
      found closer to the all-weather roads, and they were smaller in size, thereby, suggesting
      greater land fragmentation. Results of Ttests indicated that the closer to the road, the
      greater was the change to non-forest. Geomorphic setting and LULC change were explicitly
      linked, thereby, suggesting that the density of forest to non-forest increased within 200
      meters from the road in all landform types.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study examines how reporters use workplace or newsroom narratives as guides for
      correct action in making ethical decisions. This analysis, based on in-depth interviews,
      employs the theory of narrative inquiry from the field of communication. The study shows that
      these narratives can lead to discussions on broader ethical matters. The journalists in this
      analysis consider narratives as part of their guidance system in their ethical
      decision-making. This dissertation looks at the decisionmaking process of a dozen reporters at
      weekly and major-market daily newspapers in the United States. These experienced journalists
      were interviewed in-depth. They were from the states of Arizona, California, Maryland, Ohio,
      Massachusetts, New York, Michigan, and Iowa. This study suggests that ethics codes or other
      forms of guidance are not as influential as the "cautionary tales" or
      newsroom narratives.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation presents a new and efficient next-best-view algorithm for 3D
      reconstruction of indoor environments using active range sensing. A major challenge in range
      acquisition for 3D reconstruction is an efficient automated view planning algorithm to
      determine a sequence of scanning locations or views such that a set of acquisition constraints
      and requirements is satisfied and the object or environment of interest can be satisfactorily
      reconstructed. Due to the intractability of the view planning problem and the lack of global
      geometric information, a greedy approach is adopted to approximate the solution. A practical
      view metric is formulated to include many real-world acquisition constraints and
      reconstruction quality requirements. This view metric is flexible to allow trade-offs between
      different requirements of the reconstruction quality. A major contribution of this work is the
      application of a hierarchical approach to greatly accelerate the evaluation of the view metric
      for a large set of views. This is achieved by exploiting the various spatial coherences in the
      acquisition constraints and reconstruction quality requirements when evaluating the view
      metric. The hierarchical view evaluation algorithm is implemented in a view planning system
      targeted for the acquisition of indoor environments using a monostatic range scanner with 3D
      pose. The results show great speedups over the straightforward method used in many previous
      algorithms. The view planning system has also been shown to be robust for realworld
      application. The dissertation also describes how the view metric can be generalized to
      incorporate general acquisition constraints and requirements, and how the hierarchical view
      evaluation algorithm can be generalized to scanners with general pose, and to scanners with
      bistatic sensors. A simple extension is also proposed to enable the hierarchical view
      evaluation algorithm to take into account each view's sensitivity to the potential pose errors
      in the physical positioning of the scanner. A computed new view must produce a range image
      that can be accurately registered to the previous scans. In this work, a metric is developed
      to estimate the registration accuracy of the views. This metric considers the amount of
      overlap, the range measurement errors, and the shape complexity of the surfaces.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>An extensive amount of research examines the relationship between management practices
      and performance (performance-oriented literature) as well as that between national culture and
      management practices (cross-cultural literature). However, few studies attempt to draw from
      each of these literatures by examining the influence of national culture on the
      practice-performance relationship. I develop a performance oriented cross-cultural framework
      and illustrate the potential of this framework by generating a number of hypotheses using
      three management practices: Transformational leadership, contingent compensation, and goal
      setting. I describe the methodological approach I use to test these hypotheses, including how
      data was collected from a large multinational corporation in the hospitality industry and a
      description of the sample and measures that were used. I then provide the results of the data
      analysis, and discuss the implications of these results.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study examines German-American relations during the European general crisis of
      1921-1924/5. After World War I, Germany's primary foreign policy goal was to engage the United
      States, whose assistance was seen as essential for the economic and diplomatic rehabilitation
      of Germany. America recognized that the rehabilitation of Germany was necessary for its long
      range goal of aiding peaceful European reconstruction through private loans and investments.
      Having failed to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, America had to establish bilateral relations
      with Germany. However the complex interplay of domestic and international politics in each
      nation resulted in a relationship which proceeded in a series of steps characterized by
      expediency imposed by the domestic politics of the United States. Following this pattern were
      the Treaty of Berlin of 1921 (which established a separate peace with Germany), the Mixed
      Claims Agreement of 1922 (which was created to resolve war claims), and the Commercial Treaty
      of 1924. The American-German relationship was also central to the resolution of the complex
      international problem of war debts and reparations. Political conflict in Germany over
      distribution of the war's costs among various social and economic groups kept it from making
      credible reparations proposals and engaging the United States, which disengaged further in
      response to the January 1923 French/Belgian occupation of the Ruhr and Germany's reactive
      policy of passive resistance. Due to optimism over Germany's ending of passive resistance and
      institution of domestic economic reforms together with concern about the chaos in Germany
      caused by the occupation, American opinion shifted and the Coolidge administration called for
      an inquiry into the reparation problem by a committee of experts. The resulting 1924 Dawes
      Plan and the London agreements established a reparations settlement and modification the
      Versailles Treaty on Anglo-American terms. This opened the way for American financial
      underwriting of German reconstruction and the resolution of the European crisis.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This research, undertaken as part of a larger, multi-temporal study of social
      relations and land use, examines parish registers for the commune of Uxeau (Canton of
      Gueugnon, Département of Saône-et-Loire, region of Burgundy, France) during the coldest decade
      of the "Little Ice Age." The work explores the types of analyses and
      research questions appropriate for very early registers that cover short intervals. Such
      registers usually lack the supplemental and corroborating records available for later periods,
      such as census lists, household enumerations and tax records. Analyses performed include some
      simple aggregative calculations and a thorough family reconstitution. More unusually, this
      study places particular emphasis on the peripheral entries not always included in the data
      bases for family reconstitution-those notations in addition to the main facts of baptism,
      marriage and burial, which provide detailed information on persons acting as godparents,
      marriage witnesses and mourners. Incorporating this data, allows extended family groups to be
      reconstructed for up to four generations, using parish records covering a period of only ten
      years-something that would otherwise have taken several decades worth of data to accomplish.
      It is the ties represented in the peripheral data that make possible the reconstruction of the
      social network, parish hierarchy, and economic relations within the parish. For example, the
      spatial mapping of the occupational data and the patterns of social alliances reveals two
      distinct agricultural ecotypes within the parish. The ten-year period of the study coincides
      with the coldest decade of "The Little Ice Age" and surrounds the
      "Great Mortality" from the famine of 1693-1694. The strategies for marriage
      and godparent alliances that emerge from the analyses appear to have effectively reduced risk
      in that precarious decade of harvest failures, uncertain land tenure and exorbitant taxes.
      Most of the inhabitants of the parish belonged to large communautés, a communal type of farm
      made up of multiple, cohabitating, extended family groups. The study shows some significant
      differences in the practices of these communautés from those of later periods and neighboring
      regions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study explores the lived experiences of pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood
      among African American women living in central North Carolina. Although there are many
      anthropological studies of reproduction, there is very little in the way of explorations of
      the lived experiences of pregnancy. This work was conducted between April 2002 and July 2003
      with a group of 62 African American women who received prenatal care at a local OB-GYN office
      founded by two African American physicians and located in central North Carolina. An in-depth
      analysis of life history interviews with six of these women grounds the final analysis. I have
      used an overarching theoretical framework that examines pregnancy as a life process and a
      unique physiological event in order to understand the full range of life experiences that can
      come to bear on a woman's pregnancy. I have combined phenomenological understandings of
      perception and embodiment to explore the intersections of social, cultural and existential
      life in the contexts of pregnancy and motherhood. The women in this study have pointed to
      experiences of pregnancy that include experiencing pregnancy as fear of bearing a son and have
      developed a new way of understanding class experience in the context of a lived pregnancy.
      This study has pointed to experiences in African American women's lives that are positively,
      negatively, or neutrally felt that inform how they live their pregnancies. Those negatively
      felt experiences and perceptions that are related to being a pregnant African American woman
      emerged out of lived experiences in a racist U.S. culture whose histories, practices and
      ideologies of exclusion are still based on skin color. This work is informed by a Black
      Feminist perspective in which the researcher is compelled to engage in a "critical
      radical praxis" to effect change in African American women's lives. The goal of my
      research has been to provide information about those lived experiences of pregnancy in the
      lives of African American women that may help to address persistent and glaring inequalities
      in health.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique that is capable of a wide range
      of chemical and biological analyses. The quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (QITMS) is
      known for its ruggedness, sensitivity, and high efficiency for tandem mass spectrometry
      (MS/MS) experiments. Non-idealities in electrode geometry result in small contributions of
      higher order fields (HOFs) to the primary quadrupolar electric field of the ion trap. These
      HOFs have been useful in enhancing the resolution, MS/MS efficiency, and sensitivity in the
      QITMS. A portion of the work presented in this dissertation is intended to serve as a basis
      for improved ion trap performance through the judicious use of HOFs. Development of rf
      circuitry and characterization of a compensated cylindrical ion trap (CCIT) mass spectrometer,
      designed for studying the effects of HOFs, are also described herein. An additional set of
      grounded electrodes was introduced into the CCIT instrument to remove detrimental effects of
      capacitive coupling and HOFs were successfully introduced. Mass spectra acquired after the
      introduction of HOFs showed improvements to the injection efficiency over a broad range of rf
      voltages. The optimal conditions for resonance ejection in the CCIT occurred at an octapole
      HOF non-linear resonance, which gave improvements both to mass resolution and sensitivity
      (i.e., the number of ions detected). Resonance ejection performed at an octapole non-linear
      resonance was successful in improving the sensitivity of the CCIT for the analysis of volatile
      organic compounds in the presence of a heavy buffer gas. A novel higher order field ion trap,
      possessing predominantly octapole fields, was developed. This octapole ion trap exhibited
      higher trapping capacity than a quadrupole ion trap of similar geometry. However, mass
      analysis in the octapole ion trap was not achievable because ions were resonantly ejected over
      a broad frequency range. A second generation octapole ion trap, with improved resonance
      ejection characteristics, also was developed. Resonance ejection experiments in this geometry
      were in agreement with ion trajectory simulations, but mass analysis using resonance ejection
      was again not possible due to broad band ejection. A non-destructive Fourier transform
      detection method was simulated and found to be viable.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this work, certain probability approximation schemes are applied to two different
      contexts: one under stochastic volatility models in financial econometrics and the other about
      the hierarchical clustering of directional data on the unit (hyper)sphere. In both cases,
      approximations play an important role in improving the computational efficiency. In the first
      part, we study stochastic volatility models. As an indispensable part of Bayesian inference
      using MCMC, we need to compute the option prices for each iteration at each time. To
      facilitate the computation, an approximation scheme is proposed for numerical computation of
      the option prices based on a central limit theorem, and some error bounds for the
      approximations are obtained. The second part of the work originates from studying microarray
      data. After pre-processing the microarray data, each gene is represented by a unit vector. To
      study their patterns, we adopt hierarchical clustering and introduce the idea of linking by
      the size of a spherical cap. In this way, each cluster is represented by a spherical cap. By
      studying the distribution of direction data on the unit (hyper)sphere, we can assess the
      significance of observing a big cluster using Poisson approximations.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Many nano-composites consist of rod-like or platelet macromolecules in a solvent
      matrix, which are observed to yield large property enhancements at very low volume fraction.
      These particle suspensions are called liquid crystal polymers because they order at a critical
      volume fraction. In this dissertation, we study the role of the orientational distribution
      function of liquid crystal polymers and high aspect ratio particle dispersions in composite
      properties. Chapter I provides a review of the kinetic theory of owing rod dispersions. In
      Chapters II and III, we use homogenization theory to predict volume-averaged effective
      properties (specifically thermal conductivity and mechanical properties) versus particle
      volume fraction, aspect ratio and shear rate. The formulas we derive are in terms of second
      and fourth moments of the orientational distribution function of the inclusions. We close with
      recent progress on percolation in rod dispersions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Spherical, cylindrical and vesicle micelles were formed from
      polystyrene-blockpolyisoprene copolymer in heptane. The micelle morphology, critical micelle
      concentration, aggregation number, hydrodynamic radius, core radius, shell thickness, core
      density, and cylindrical micelle length were studied by a combination of scattering techniques
      and atomic force microscopy. The experimental results were compared with recently developed
      theoretical models. The crew-cut asymptotic model was found to inaccurate for all measured
      parameters even in the range of small polyisoprene blocks where it should be most applicable.
      The start-like asymptotic model correctly captured most of the data in the range of large
      polyisoprene block size, i.e. when the micelles were the most star-like. The numerical
      solution was seen to accurately predict most of the physical properties in the full range of
      polyisoprene block size studied. In addition it was found that reversible morphological
      transitions from cylindrical to spherical micelles as well as vesicle to cylindrical micelles
      can be induced solely through temperature changes. However, the reverse process, upon cooling,
      is much slower than the transition while heating.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The optical properties of spin coated thin films of poly(o-methoxyaniline) (POMA) were
      investigated using spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) complimented by optical absorption
      spectroscopy in the visible-near UV optical range and atomic force microscopy (AFM) for
      surface roughness. For these studies a custom built ellipsometer was constructed and
      interfaced with a computer and software was written in LABVIEW™ for automation. A Gaussian
      oscillator optical model was used to fit the data obtained from SE. roughness results were
      also evaluated in an optical model. The effect of different spin deposit conditions including
      spin rate, and concentration of solution and deposition ambient on the POMA film thickness,
      surface roughness, optical properties and optical anisotropy have been investigated. Small
      uniaxial anisotropy has been measured and annealing leads to some densification and surface
      smoothing. Organic thin film transistors (OTFT) were fabricated with POMA as the active
      semiconductor layer, silicon dioxide (SiO2) as the gate dielectric, heavily doped silicon as
      the substrate, and vacuum evaporated gold lines as the source and drain contacts. The
      electronic properties were characterized using a custom built probe station. The custom probe
      station was also automated with software program written in LabVIEW™. POMA yielded a P-channel
      device, and from transfer characteristic and turn-on plot, the charge mobility was calculated
      which was in the range of about 10-3 cm2 V-1 s-1. Various post fabrication processes were
      carried out to optimize the device performance. Controlled doping and moderate annealing have
      shown improvement in the device mobility by 10 folds and 2 folds respectively, yielding
      evidence for a hopping mechanism for charge transport in POMA. Two alternate gate dielectric
      layers for the OTFT were also considered; while a nonpolar low-K dielectric, polyethylene
      improved mobility; polar high-K dielectric, copolymer of vinylidene fluoride with
      trifluoroethylene had an adverse effect on mobility.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this thesis, the feasibility of scCO2 as both a processing medium and a
      polymerization medium for preparation of polymer/clay nanocomposites has been explored, with
      the first part discussing a CO2-mediated intercalation of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) in clay.
      It has been shown that CO2 can act as a plasticizer to promote intercalation similar to that
      achieved in polymer melts. Intercalation kinetics in both melt intercalation and CO2-mediated
      intercalation were studied by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Data and results
      towards both intercalation kinetic and thermal behavior of PEO were discussed. In the second
      part, we explored the feasibility of scCO2 as a polymerization medium for in-situ
      polymerization of vinyl monomers and exfoliation of clay. By using a CO2- philic fluorinated
      surfactant (10F-clay) to modify clay, partially exfoliated poly(methyl methacrylate)
      (PMMA)/clay nanocomposites were synthesized in high yields via a pseudo-dispersion
      polymerization of MMA in scCO2. It was found that 10F-clay was an effective stabilizer (as
      compared to conventional hydrocarbon surfactant modified clay) for PMMA polymerization in CO2.
      A stabilization mechanism was proposed, wherein FT-IR studies indicated hydrogen bond
      formation between MMA and clay. Thermal and mechanical properties of the PMMA nanocomposites
      were also studied. Pseudo-dispersion polymerization was also conducted on polystyrene to study
      the effect of clay on non-hydrogen-bonding polymers. By using a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)
      surfactant to modify clay, PMMA and polystyrene/clay nanocomposites were synthesized and
      compared in this study. The effects of the PDMS-clay concentration on polymer conversion,
      molecular weight, and morphology were investigated. The distributions of clay in both polymers
      were compared, and two different interaction mechanisms were proposed. The effects of clay
      distribution on both thermal properties and mechanical properties of the polymers have also
      been discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Bratteli-Vershik systems, also called adics, are dynamical systems defined on the
      infinite path space of a Bratteli diagram. We introduce a family adics called limited scope
      adics for which the number of vertices increases by a constant at each level, and a subfamily
      determined by positive integer polynomials. We show that the dimension groups of the Bratteli
      diagrams associated to limited scope adics are intrinsically linked to the dynamics,
      generalizing a result for Cantor minimal systems, and we explicitly compute them for the
      subfamily of adics determined by a positive integer polynomials. We show that certain limited
      scope adics are isomorphic to subshifts. For the systems determined by positive integer
      polynomials we show that the set of fully-supported invariant ergodic probability measures
      consists of a one-parameter family of Bernoulli measures. We also show that the systems
      associated to positive integer polynomials are loosely Bernoulli. A particular limited scope
      adic system is the Euler adic system, for which the number of paths from the root vertex to a
      vertex (n,k) is the Eulerian number A(n,k). We show that this system has a unique
      fully-supported invariant ergodic probability measure and that the system is totally ergodic
      and loosely Bernoulli.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>We give a classification of cellular automata in arbitrary dimensions and on arbitrary
      subshift spaces from the point of view of symbolic and topological dynamics. A cellular
      automaton is a continuous, shift-commuting map on a subshift space; these objects were first
      investigated from a purely mathematical point of view by Hedlund in 1969. In the 1980's,
      Wolfram categorized one-dimensional cellular automata based on features of their asymptotic
      behavior which could be seen on a computer screen. Gilman's work in 1987 and 1988 was the
      first attempt to mathematically formalize these characterizations of Wolfram's, using notions
      of equicontinuity, expansiveness, and measure-theoretic analogs of each. We introduce a
      topological classification of cellular automata in dimensions two and higher based on the
      one-dimensional classification given by Kurka. We characterize equicontinuous cellular
      automata in terms of periodicity, investigate the occurrence of blocking patterns as related
      to points of equicontinuity, demonstrate that topologically transitive cellular automata are
      both surjective and have sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and construct subshift
      spaces in all dimensions on which there exists an expansive cellular automaton. We provide
      numerous examples throughout and conclude with two diagrams illustrating the interaction of
      topological properties in all dimensions for the cases of an underlying full shift space and
      of an underlying subshift space with dense shift-periodic points.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Flaubert attacked what he called "avachissement universel," the
      spread of bourgeois stupidity to all aspects of French culture. Faulkner also coined a term
      that indicated his concern with cultural changes, "snopesism." The
      differences between these two concepts, bovarism and snopesism, manifest a dramatic shift in
      the representation of society effected by the rise of commodity culture. Focusing on classical
      topoi as particularly dense cultural signifiers, I look at the developing presentations of
      culture in Absalom, Absalom! and Madame Bovary. As stable referents of bourgeois culture,
      classical topoi strongly identify a set of cultural values for Flaubert that he can then
      ironize. Faulkner, by contrast, demonstrates the destabilization of cultural referents with
      the "rise of the redneck" signaled by snopesism. However, while Flaubertian
      irony relies on the bourgeois betise he criticizes, Faulkner's critique of snopesism develops
      the tensions between utopian fantasies of fulfillment and irretrievable loss</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>José Sanchis Sinisterra's play El lector por horas takes the traditional concept of
      the reader-text relationship within a drama beyond its conventional boundaries through the use
      of fragmentation and escritura del hueco, or the practice of incorporating only small
      fragments of another author's text within his own play in order to mold the other text to fit
      his own devices. By doing so he is refracting the customarily accepted notion that the
      reader-text relationship is one-on-one. Instead, he filters his borrowed texts through a
      series of lenses, thereby redirecting them and assigning new meaning. Thus he allows them to
      appropriately work within his drama. The result is to endow his audience with multiple
      refractions of the original texts used within the play, thereby redefining the relationship
      between a text and its receptor. Sanchis has created a fresh perception of the conventional
      process of reading.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Our purpose was to compare the recovery patterns of athletes reporting headache at
      baseline (PAH) and athletes reporting posttraumatic headache (PTH) following concussion. The
      study involved two separate analyses of concussed high school and collegiate athletes
      classified based on baseline headache scores and another by headache scores at twenty-four
      hours postinjury. All subjects completed a graded symptom checklist. A subset of subjects
      completed the Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) and the Balance Error Scoring System
      (BESS) at baseline and days one, three, and seven post-injury. A smaller subset completed ANAM
      at a sub-acute session (1-2 days post-injury) and a prolonged session (5-7 days postinjury).
      Significant differences in symptomatology and mental status (p&lt;.05) were observed for
      PAH and PTH. Differences were also observed in balance and neuropsychological performance
      scores regarding PTH. (p&lt;.05) Results suggest that headache scores (PAH and PTH) should
      be considered in the interpretation of clinical measures of concussion.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Social movements are, by their very nature, public relations initiatives which exact
      change at the societal level. The modern American gay movement is no exception. Its leap onto
      America's front page is often marked by the Stonewall Riots of 1969. Indicative of most social
      movements, the gay experience has witnessed social unrest, community mobilization, and
      certainly push-back from a mainstream, heterocentric dominant culture. But as more critical
      battles are waged, and as more milestones are achieved, it is critical to analyze the current
      state of the gay movement "from within." Through a qualitative
      content-analysis and a series of in-depth interviews, this study attempts to define today's
      gay movement, analyze whose voices within the movement are being heard, and investigate the
      assumption of the "gay movement" as a traditional social movement.
      Ultimately, the research aims to determine how LGBT persons perceive the community's path to
      achieving a place at society's table.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study considers the representation of ways in which female characters help one
      another in prose and plays written in France between 1650 and 1750. The concept of mentoring,
      an idea whose roots in western thought may be traced to ancient Greece, is applied to
      mother-daughter relationships as well as to friendships in an effort to explore how French
      literature of this period portrayed women negotiating the obstacles they faced during the
      Ancien Régime. Six primary texts were selected for their rich development of female
      characters' relationships in stories of young women coming of age. Included are novellas
      Célinte (1661) and Mathilde (1667) by Madeleine de Scudéry, plays La double inconstance (1723)
      and La mère confidente (1735) by Pierre de Marivaux, and Françoise de Graffigny's novel
      Lettres d'une Péruvienne (1747) and her play Cénie (1750).</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In humans, periodontal disease has been associated with an increased risk for preterm
      and low birth weight deliveries. Among the periodontal pathogens, Campylobacter rectus (C.
      rectus) appears to play a key role in these processes. Several animal models have been
      developed to study the effects of periodontal bacteria on pregnancy outcomes, and demonstrate
      their deleterious consequences on fetal growth. Since the placenta is the organ where nutrient
      exchange takes place between the mother and the fetus, and since its normal development is
      considered of crucial importance for the normal growth and development of the fetus, our
      hypothesis is that maternal infection with C. rectus impairs placental function and
      development, which may contribute to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). We used a
      pregnancy/infection mouse model and found that C. rectus infection leads to IUGR. Moreover,
      the bacteria not only disseminated to the placenta, but also translocated to fetal tissues
      where they have the capacity of invading host cells. The presence of C. rectus in the placenta
      may have mediated structural changes in this organ, with the most significant being the
      decrease of the labyrinth and the increase of the decidual layer. These alterations could have
      been induced by the down-regulation in the expression of genes important for placental and
      fetal growth and development. Among these genes several imprinted genes, such as Igf2, were
      included. Finally, we found that C. rectus infection induced hypermethylation of the promoter
      of Igf2. This may present a possible mechanism for the down-regulation of this gene and
      possibly of other imprinted genes. The data from this study provide information about
      potential mechanisms that underlie the impaired fetal growth after maternal infection with the
      periodontal pathogen C. rectus. Moreover, since changes in the methylation patterns of genes
      are usually inherited in somatic cells, our data raise the possibility that infection-mediated
      epigenetic modifications of the DNA, that occur in utero, may predispose the individual for
      diseases that appear later in life.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Ozone is a secondary pollutant resulting from complex reactions of two precursors:
      nitrogen oxides (NOX), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) under ozone-conducive
      meteorological conditions. Thus, the ozone modeling becomes complex and needs rigorous model
      performance evaluations (MPE) before the modeling results are used for air quality decisions.
      In the past regulatory ozone modeling, however, virtually all MPE practices were
      over-simplified by following the EPA's current MPE method. That is, modelers cannot answer the
      most important question in applying air quality models for ozone decision-making processes
      with the EPA's MPE method: "why should I believe this modeling?" In this
      study I investigated a solution by integrating the theoretical advances of MPE for
      environmental modeling with my practical knowledge in regulatory ozone modeling. As a result,
      I developed an MPE method with which modelers must (1) gather and examine
      graphical/statistical measures in a systematic manner, (2) conduct in-depth analyses with
      respect to potential ozone control options, and (3) report their performance assessments
      explicitly in light of policy questions. Because the existing analysis tools showed
      significant shortcomings in implementing the new MPE method, a new tool was developed to
      exercise the new MPE method efficiently. With the new tool, modelers can accomplish MPE tasks
      necessitated by the new MPE method in a timely manner. iii The Houston-Galveston Mid-Course
      Review (HGMCR) modeling was re-evaluated as the case study to demonstrate the advantages of
      new MPE method. I could reveal that the HGMCR modeling showed significantly low reliability
      even though the model could pass the majority of EPA's simple statistical tests. That is, the
      model showed significantly high biases in winds, NOX, and VOCs. Two major roots of high biases
      were identified: (1) the highly reactive VOCs (HRVOC) adjustment that was not scientifically
      defensible and (2) the insufficient modeling grid resolution with respect to the nature of
      ozone problems in Houston. Ultimately, the application of new MPE method led me to develop an
      alternative modeling case with which I showed that the alternative case could be used in a
      limited way to test a certain type of HRVOC control strategies by reducing VOCs biases.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Forward head and rounded shoulder posture (FHRSP) has been identified as a potential
      risk factor for the development of shoulder pain. The mechanism through which forward head and
      rounded shoulder can facilitate shoulder injury is not well understood. Altered scapular
      kinematics, muscle activity, and shoulder joint coordination due to FHRSP may lead to the
      development of shoulder pain. However, there is little evidence to support the influence of
      FHRSP on scapular kinematics, muscle activity, and shoulder joint coordination. Therefore, the
      purpose of this study was to compare scapular kinematics, muscle activity, and shoulder joint
      coordination in individuals with and without FHRSP. Eighty volunteers without shoulder pain
      were classified as having FHRSP or ideal posture. An electromagnetic tracking system together
      with hard-wired surface electromyography was used to collect three-dimensional scapular
      kinematics concurrently with muscle activity of the upper and lower trapezius as well as the
      serratus anterior during iv loaded shoulder flexion and an overhead reaching task. Separate
      mixed model analyses of variance were used to compare three dimensional scapular kinematics,
      muscle activity, and shoulder joint coordination during the ascending and descending phases of
      the loaded flexion and overhead reaching tasks. Individuals with FHRSP displayed significant
      increases in scapular upward rotation, internal rotation, and anterior tipping during the
      loaded flexion and reaching tasks. Significant decreases in serratus anterior muscle
      activation during the ascending phase of the flexion and reaching tasks were also noted. These
      scapular kinematic and muscle activation patterns are similar to those reported in individuals
      with shoulder pain. Additionally, uncoupled scapulohumeral coordination strategies were also
      observed for scapular upward rotation and anterior tipping. The observed uncoupling suggests
      an out-of-phase relationship between the humerus and these scapular rotations in individuals
      with FHRSP. Considered together, these results suggest FHRSP influences scapular kinematics,
      muscle activity, and shoulder joint coordination. FHRSP and its effects on shoulder
      kinematics, muscle activity, and shoulder coordination should be examined as a potential risk
      factor in the development of shoulder pain. Assessment and treatment of FHRSP should be
      considered in the prevention and interventions of shoulder pain.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The swine industry has expanded rapidly in North Carolina over the last two decades.
      Animals are raised in confined facilities where waste is flushed into open-air lagoons and the
      liquid phase is land-applied to receiving fields as an organic fertilizer. The
      post-application fate has not been fully documented. Therefore, on three occasions I
      experimentally applied liquid swine waste at typical doses (40 to 130 kg N ha-2) to defined
      plots in an active spray field on a representative North Carolina swine production facility
      and constructed an N mass balance for a 14 to 18 d period. Most of the N (52%) was assimilated
      into plants, while surprisingly little (9%) was volatilized. Microbial immobilization
      accounted for 10% of the applied N, while 12% migrated below the active soil zone (surface 20
      cm) and was presumably lost to groundwater. The soil storage term averaged 16%, while the
      denitrification sink was inconsequential (&lt;1%).</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Bcl-3 was originally identified as a protein that is highly expressed in certain
      B-cell lymphomas harboring a 14;19 translocation, and more recent evidence indicates that its
      expression is characteristic of a large number of human cancers. A member of the I?B family of
      NF-?B inhibitors, Bcl-3 interacts with NF-?B dimers containing p50 or p52 and promotes
      transcription of a subset of NF-?B dependent genes. However, neither the role of Bcl-3 in
      oncogenesis, nor its role in normal physiology, has been clearly defined. My research has
      focused on elucidating the function of Bcl-3 in the context of DNA damage signaling in order
      to gain insight into its physiological and pathological roles. Experiments presented here
      indicate that Bcl-3 is inducible by DNA damage and is required for the induction of Hdm2 gene
      expression and the suppression of persistent p53 activity. Furthermore, constitutive
      expression of Bcl-3 suppresses DNA damage-induced p53 activation and inhibits p53-induced
      apoptosis through a mechanism that is at least partly dependent on the upregulation of Hdm2.
      The results provide insight into a mechanism whereby altered expression of Bcl-3 leads to
      tumorigenic potential. Since Bcl-3 is required for germinal center formation, these results
      further indicate that Bcl-3 may play a critical in the B-cell maturation process by
      suppressing p53-dependent apoptosis in response to somatic hypermutation and class switch
      recombination. iii As aberrant expression of Bcl-3 has been found in an increasing number of
      human cancers, my second project set out to investigate whether Bcl-3 plays a role in
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The data indicate that nuclear staining of Bcl-3 is present in
      a high percentage of primary HCC tumors compared to adjacent normal tissue. Furthermore,
      western blot analysis indicates that high Bcl-3 expression correlates positively with
      expression of Hdm-2. These data suggest that Bcl-3 may play a causal role in HCC and indicate
      that it may be functioning through inhibition of p53. Collectively, the work described here
      proposes a novel function for the oncoprotein Bcl-3 that provides insight into both its normal
      and oncogenic roles and provides further evidence for the expanding role of Bcl-3 in human
      cancer.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Low back pain (LBP) is a significant problem for commercial fishermen. Little research
      has been done to investigate the ergonomic stress of occupational fishing tasks, and no
      previous study has explored the link between low back stress and LBP in fishing. This study
      quantified low back stresses during commercial crab and gillnet fishing tasks and determined
      the association between those stresses and LBP occurrences reported in a prospective cohort
      study of North Carolina commercial fishermen conducted April 1999 to October 2001. Two
      ergonomic methods measured the percent of time fishermen were exposed to low back stress in a
      sample of 29 commercial fishermen. Fishing task frequency was evaluated in a telephone
      questionnaire with cohort crab pot and gillnet fishermen (n=105). Multivariate generalized
      Poisson regression modeled the occurrence rate ratios (RR, 95% CI) of LBP that limited or
      interrupted work (severe LBP) by percent time exposed to high low back stress and
      self-reported task. The rate of severe LBP was 0.69 per 1000 person-days (95% CI: 0.47, 0.90).
      Age, years of experience and previous severe LBP were associated with severe LBP. Handling
      heavy loads during loading and unloading produced high compression (3400 to 5315 Newtons) and
      lifting index values (3.0 to 5.4), but contributed little to overall work iv time (0-14%).
      Unloading the boat with or without use of a lifting aid was associated with an increased rate
      of severe LBP. Sorting catch, due to the large portion of time in static, nonneutral trunk
      postures (83% task time, 27-53% total work time), was associated with an increased rate of LBP
      (1.80 95% CI: 0.78, 4.13). Overall, increased rates of LBP were associated with the percent of
      time fishermen were exposed to awkward postures, spine compression &gt;3400 Newtons, and
      NIOSH lifting index &gt;3.0. Our results demonstrate that neither fishing task frequency
      nor ergonomic measure alone consistently predict LBP. Age, history of LBP, and self-selection
      out of tasks were likely important contributors to the patterns of low back stress and
      outcomes we observed. Research should involve fishermen in future intervention studies to
      account for these behaviors and increase adoption and diffusion of beneficial interventions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Photolyase and cryptochrome comprise a family of structurally related bluelight
      photoreceptors. Photolyase repairs UV damaged DNA and cryptochromes mediate a variety of
      growth and adaptive responses. In this study, three genes, phr, cry1, and cry2, belonging to
      the photolyase/cryptochrome blue-light photoreceptor family in the V. cholerae genome were
      biochemically and genetically characterized. All three proteins contained the folate and
      flavin cofactors. One of these proteins, VcPhr, was found to be a CPD photolyase belonging the
      Class I photolyases. VcCry1 was found to have a small amount of CPD photolyase activity and
      belongs to the DASH subfamily. VcCry2 belongs to the DASH-related subfamily. Additionally, I
      present evidence of a new class of CPD photolyases, Class III photolyases. I have also
      performed a thorough phylogenetic analysis of the superfamily and have identified conserved
      motifs unique to individual subclasses and the tertiary location of the conserved regions. I
      have proposed reclassifying DASH cryptochromes as a novel class of photolyases. Also,
      presented is the homo- and heterodimerization of vertebrate cryptochromes. Additionally the
      ancient origins of vertebrate-like cryptochromes were traced back to over one billion years
      ago.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Children with Hurler syndrome have significant impairments to body structure and
      function that result from glycosaminoglycans accumulating in cells throughout the body. Little
      is known about activity limitations or more specifically gross motor and gait abilities in
      this population. The advent of new treatments such as umbilical cord blood transplantation
      (UCBT) is increasing the lifespan of children with Hurler syndrome. Information on gross motor
      and gait abilities with and without medical interventions such as UCBT will enable the medical
      community, therapists, and families to help children with Hurler syndrome maximize their motor
      abilities. The purpose of this dissertation was to describe the gross motor and gait abilities
      of children with Hurler syndrome pre and post UCBT. The first study presents a case series of
      4 children who had not received medical intervention to alter their enzyme levels. The second
      study describes changes in gross motor abilities over time for 21 children who received UCBT.
      The third study describes changes in selected gait parameters of 18 children with Hurler
      syndrome post UCBT. The combined results of these studies indicate that children with Hurler
      syndrome have below average gross motor abilities and significant joint range of motion
      impairments by 10 months of age. Gross motor abilities are most delayed in the area of
      locomotion prior to and after UCBT. Following UCBT, children with Hurler syndrome gain
      locomotor and object manipulation abilities at the same iii or a faster rate than typically
      developing children. However, they gain stationary balance abilities at a rate slower than
      their peers. In addition, children with Hurler syndrome post UBCT walk with age appropriate
      velocity and step length by 48 months of age, after having immature gait at 24 and 36 months
      of age. The findings from this dissertation suggest that children with Hurler syndrome do have
      the ability to gain new gross motor abilities and improve gait velocity and step length with
      increasing time post-UCBT. However, significant discrepancies in the children's abilities on
      various gross motor domains maybe related to orthopedic conditions, strength, and balance
      deficits. There findings warrant further investigation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Photolyase and cryptochrome flavoproteins help living organisms manage the deleterious
      and beneficial effects of sunlight. Photolyase maintains genome integrity by reversing
      UV-induced DNA damage with near-UV/blue-light, and cryptochromes act as bluelight photosensory
      receptors to regulate growth in plants and entrainment of circadian rhythms in both plants and
      animals. Although photolyase and cryptochrome are highly structurally homologous and the
      photocycle of photolyase is known in great detail, we do not currently understand how
      cryptochromes signal in response to light. It is hypothesized that cryptochrome, like
      photolyase, employs light-driven electron transfer to initiate signaling, although the
      photocycle and other downstream signaling events remain to be described in detail. The studies
      described here were designed to take advantage of differences and similarities in the known
      functions of photolyases and cryptochromes in order to characterize the signaling mechanisms
      of cryptochromes. An examination of the structural and biochemical properties of plant and
      animal cryptochromes demonstrates that although they evolved independently from functionally
      distinct photolyase progenitors, they possess several unexpected similarities, demonstrating
      convergence in the evolution of cryptochromes. The implications of these results for the
      cryptochrome photocycle are discussed. Metazoan cryptochromes additionally have a critical,
      light-independent function in the molecular clock that engenders circadian rhythms. Other
      studies have shown that iv cryptochromes act as transcriptional repressors in the major
      transcription/translation feedback loop of the clock. I studied the interaction of mammalian
      cryptochromes with protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) and show that inhibition of PP5 by cryptochrome
      modulates the activity of the major clock kinase, casein kinase I epsilon. PP5 is required for
      proper cycling of the clock; therefore, these data provide the first demonstration of the role
      of a phosphatase in the mammalian circadian clock. Furthermore, they suggest that
      cryptochromes regulate the molecular clock by both transcriptional and posttranslational
      mechanisms.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), a product of the GCPII gene, is highly
      expressed as a largely extracellular membrane-anchored protein in malignant prostate tissues
      and in non-prostatic tumor neovasculature. Alternatively spliced variants of PSMA include the
      PSM', PSMA 6, and PSMA 18 transcripts. PSM' is produced by use of an alternate upstream 5'
      splice site in exon 1 and produces a cytoplasmic localized protein missing PSMA's
      transmembrane domain. The PSMA/PSM' splice ratio changes from predominately PSM' in normal and
      benign prostate tissues to predominately PSMA in prostate cancer. Variants PSMA 6 and PSMA 18
      are produced by exon exclusion of exons 6 and 18, respectively, by the splicing machinery. If
      properly translated, PSMA 6 protein retains its membrane targeting, but lacks PSMA's enzymatic
      and dimerization domains; PSMA 18 lacks only the dimerization domain. Both exon exclusion
      products should not produce functional proteins. Extensive studies have shown the ability of
      antisense oligonucleotides to target specific splicing elements in pre-mRNA to alter
      alternative splicing patterns by interfering with splicing machinery sequence recognition.
      Therefore, iii antisense based splice switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) were targeted at or
      near the 5' splice sites of exons 1, 6, and 18 to alter PSMA splicing patterns by decreasing
      full length PSMA transcript levels and increasing PSM', PSMA 6, and PSMA 18 variant levels,
      respectively in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. We hypothesized that altering the PSMA/PSM'
      splicing ratio would affect specific properties of LNCaP malignancy including cellular
      proliferation and apoptosis levels. Also, splice switching to PSMA 6 and PSMA 18 variants
      while causing a decline in PSMA would aid identifying effects produced by a decline in PSMA
      alone. Studies in this dissertation demonstrate that treatment of LNCaP cells with SSOs did
      modulate splicing of PSMA pre-mRNA from the full length PSMA splice variant to three splice
      variants: PSM', PSMA 6, and PSMA 18 variants. Application of SSOs decreased membrane PSMA mRNA
      and protein levels and increased PSM', PSMA 6 and PSMA 18 transcript levels. As a result, PSM'
      protein was translocated to the cytoplasm while switching to PSMA 6 and PSMA 18 downregulated
      PSMA expression. NAALDase assays confirmed splice switching at the protein functional level
      and showed that PSM' retained enzymatic activity. However, we were not able to determine any
      specific effects of splice switching on LNCaP malignancy as detected by cellular proliferation
      and apoptosis.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Rho proteins are members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. They are most well
      known for their functions in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, but also have normal roles in
      nearly all aspects of cellular physiology. Aberrant regulation of Rho signaling pathways leads
      to transformation including uncontrolled growth, invasion and metastasis. As such, mediators
      of Rho protein activity are subject to intense investigation as potential targets for
      pharmacological inhibitors. In addition to GTP/GDP cycling, membrane localization of these
      GTPases is a critical determinant of their transforming ability through spatial regulation of
      their signaling interaction partners and downstream signaling pathways. In this dissertation,
      I describe my investigations into regulation of the localization and function of Wrch-1
      (Wntregulated Cdc42 homolog-1), a novel member of the Cdc42 subfamily of Rho proteins. Nearly
      all Rho proteins rely on posttranslational modifications of specific residues within their
      carboxyl termini for proper delivery to cellular membranes. For example, a required
      geranylgeranyl or farnesyl isoprenoid lipid moiety is attached by the respective
      prenyltransferase to a conserved cysteine residue within the carboxyterminal CAAX motif of Rho
      proteins. Farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs,GGTIs) are under
      investigation as iv potential anticancer drugs. I sought to determine whether Wrch-1 is a
      target for FTIs or GGTIs. In addition, Rho family proteins are also modified by
      phosphorylation and ubiquitylation that can direct protein localization and stability, but the
      role of these modifications in regulating Rho biological activity is much less well
      understood. I also investigated how posttranslational modifications might regulate the
      localization and transforming activity of Wrch-1. I found that Wrch-1 is an atypical Rho
      protein that requires the addition of palmitoyl fatty acids rather than isoprenyl groups for
      correct sorting to membranes and for its transforming ability. I defined three distinct
      membrane targeting motifs in the carboxy-terminal hypervariable domain of Wrch-1 that regulate
      its interaction with plasma membrane, endomembrane and nuclear locations. Finally, I uncovered
      a possible role for monoubiquitylation of Wrch-1 in regulating its subcellular location and
      trafficking. Thus, Wrch-1 biological activity is regulated by its subcellular distribution due
      to modification by palmitoylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitylation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>During neuronal activity extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]out) becomes
      elevated and if uncorrected causes neuronal depolarization, hyperexcitability, and seizures.
      Clearance of K+ from the extracellular space, termed K+ spatial buffering, is considered to be
      an important function of astrocytes. Results from a number of studies suggest that maintenance
      of [K+]out by astrocytes is mediated by K+ uptake through Kir4.1 channels. Furthermore, a
      missense variation in the Kir4.1 gene is linked to seizure susceptibility in mice and humans.
      To study the role of this channel in astrocyte physiology and neuronal excitability we have
      generated a conditional knockout (cKO) of Kir4.1 directed to astrocytes via human GFAP
      promoter, gfa2. Kir4.1 cKO mice die prematurely and display severe ataxia and stress-induced
      seizures. Histological analysis of Kir4.1 cKO brain and spinal cord revealed white matter
      vacuolization suggestive of oligodendrocyte pathology. Immunostaining studies confirmed
      removal of Kir4.1 from cKO astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, indicating that these cell types
      arise from a common GFAP-expressing precursor. Passive astrocytes in Kir4.1 cKO hippocampus
      appeared normal in morphology and coupling ability; however, we observed a significant loss of
      complex astrocytes suggestive of Kir4.1 role in astrocyte development. Whole-cell patch clamp
      revealed large depolarization (&gt;35 mV) of Kir4.1 cKO astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.
      Complex cell depolarization appears to be a direct consequence of Kir4.1 removal. In contrast,
      passive astrocyte depolarization seems to arise from an indirect process that may involve a
      change in Na+/K+-ATPase function. Kir4.1 cKO passive astrocytes displayed a marked impairment
      of both K+ and glutamate uptake induced by neuronal stimulation. Surprisingly, membrane and
      action potential properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons, as well as basal synaptic transmission
      due to single pulse stimulation appeared unaffected, while spontaneous neuronal activity was
      reduced in the Kir4.1 cKO. However, increased synaptic stimulation (100 pulse train) revealed
      greatly elevated (&gt;20%) post-tetanic potentiation and short-term potentiation in Kir4.1
      cKO hippocampus. Our findings implicate that through its involvement in astrocyte development
      and K+ buffering, Kir4.1 participates in the modulation of synaptic strength thereby
      modulating neuronal spontaneous activity and synaptic plasticity.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is a protozoan parasite
      transmitted by insect vectors of the subfamily Triatominae. Human infection occurs throughout
      Latin America. The epidemiology of T. cruzi infection on Ecuador has not been widely studied.
      This is a cross-sectional study of T. cruzi seroprevalence and household risk factors for T.
      cruzi seropositivity in 14 rural communities in 3 provinces of Ecuador. 3,286 subjects from
      997 households were included in the study. Seroprevalence of T. cruzi was 5.7%, 1.0%, and 3.6%
      in the sampled communities of the Manabi, Guayas, and Loja provinces, respectively.
      Seroprevalence increased with increasing age in the provinces of Manabi and Guayas, while in
      Loja the highest prevalence was seen in children younger than 10 years. In the coastal
      provinces of Manabi and Guayas, factors associated with seropositivity were living in a house
      with a palm roof (odds ratio, OR=2.63 [95% confidence interval, 1.61, 4.27]), wood walls
      (OR=5.75 [2.04, 16.18]) or cane walls (OR=2.81 [1.31, 6.04]), and the presence of firewood in
      the peridomicile area (OR=2.48 [1.54, 4.01]). Accumulation of trash outside the home was
      associated with a reduced risk of seropositivity (OR=0.25 [0.12, 0.51]). In the Andean
      province of Loja, living in a house with adobe walls and living in the same household as
      another seropositive individual were the only factors predictive of T. cruzi seropositivity.
      The risk of seropositivity was more than two times greater for an individual living in a
      household with another seropositive person in this region. Clustering of seropositives within
      households was not observed in the coastal region after adjustment for known household risk
      factors for T. cruzi infection. In conclusion, risk factors for T. cruzi transmission in
      Ecuador varied by geographic region, likely due to differing behavior of the triatomine vector
      species in each region. These findings illustrate that an understanding of the transmission
      dynamics of T. cruzi in a particular area are necessary for the development of effective
      Chagas disease control strategies in those areas.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Chronic ankle instability, repetitive giving way of the ankle, commonly develops from
      an initial ankle sprain. Our purpose was to identify factors contributing to ankle sprain, and
      whether or not kinematic, kinetic, and surface electromyography differences existed between
      mechanically unstable (MAI), functionally unstable (FAI), and comparison groups of subjects
      performing five different tasks (walking, stepping up and over, running, drop jumping, and
      stop jumping). There were 11 male and 10 female subjects in each of the three groups, matched
      by gender, age, height, mass, and limb dominance. An electromagnetic tracking system, coupled
      with a forceplate and telemetered surface electromyography were used to collect data. Unstable
      ankle subjects reported repeated episodes of spraining, and MAI subjects displayed positive
      anterior drawer and/or talar tilt tests. Using estimates of adjusted means, 95% confidence
      intervals, and effect sizes, we noted the MAI group displayed a pattern across tasks of
      increased dorsiflexion and eversion, increased frontal plane displacement and decreased
      sagittal plane displacement, with slower time to peak anterior ground reaction force in
      comparison with the FAI and comparison group. The FAI group demonstrated increased tibialis
      anterior mean amplitude as a percentage of maximum voluntary isometric contraction, but
      decreased lateral gastrocnemius mean amplitude. The coefficient of variation and standard
      deviation (SD) were obtained from an ensemble curve of each variable from the 8 test trials.
      The unstable groups displayed greater loge SD in the ankle inversion-eversion motion than the
      comparison group. The MAI group demonstrated smaller SD values for each the tibialis anterior,
      peroneals, and lateral gastrocnemius in comparison to the FAI group. The altered movement
      pattern may be a coping mechanism designed to keep the ankle in a stable position, perhaps by
      relying on bony stability and not stressing the anterior talofibular ligament. The increased
      variability observed in the unstable groups may predispose them to experience
      "risky" joint positions, closer to the limits of injury, and the FAI group
      may not activate their leg muscles enough to sufficiently rely on the muscles as dynamic
      stabilizers. These findings provide an explanation for the pathomechanics of ankle instability
      and need to be considered in rehabilitation programs.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) relays extracellular signals and delivers antigen to
      the endocytic compartment for processing and presentation. Concurrently, BCR ligation
      destabilizes Ig-alpha/Ig-beta from mu-heavy chain (mu-m). Here, we describe that receptor
      destabilization represents a physical separation of mu-m from Ig-alpha/Ig-beta. Sucrose
      gradient fractionation localized Ig-alpha/Ig-beta to GM1-containing lipid microdomains in the
      absence of mu-m. Confocal and transmission electron microscopy studies revealed colocalization
      of unsheathed mu-m with clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). Further, mu-m failed to associate
      with CCVs when receptor destabilization was inhibited, suggesting that unsheathing of mu-m is
      required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In summary, we found that antigen stimulation
      physically separates Ig-alpha/Ig-beta from mu-m, facilitating concomitant signal transduction
      and antigen delivery to the endocytic compartment. In addition, we demonstrate the molecular
      basis and the role of BCR destabilization in antigen processing. Dissociation of
      Ig-alpha/Ig-beta from mu-m requires tyrosine-587 (Y587) of the mu-m transmembrane domain.
      Receptors expressing an Y587F mutation transduced signals that were comparable to wild type
      receptors, yet failed to dissociate mu-m from Ig-alpha/Ig-alpha. Further, receptors harboring
      the Y587F mutation failed to associate with CCVs, resulting in diminished antigen in the
      lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 positive (LAMP-1+) compartments and impaired antigen
      presentation. Thus, the transmembrane tyrosine of mu-m mediates destabilization of the BCR
      complex and the association of antigen with CCVs. Our data also indicate that association of
      receptors with CCVs is required for antigen presentation. Together, we demonstrate that BCR
      destabilization reveals a novel and prerequisite step prior to the targeting of antigen into
      the endocytic pathway.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Wild birds are important non-point sources of fecal contamination of surface waters,
      as they have been reported to excrete large amounts of fecal indicator bacteria and
      occasionally harbor enteric pathogens, such as Campylobacter and Salmonella. Hundreds of
      waterfowl frequent the sandflats within Talbert Marsh, a constructed wetland in Orange County,
      CA, on a daily basis for nesting and feeding purposes. The focus of this study was on the role
      of seagull fecal contamination as a potentially important contributor to the non-point sources
      of fecal contamination into Talbert Marsh waters, which eventually flow into the recreational
      surf-zone at Huntington Beach. Using traditional microbiological methods, Salmonella,
      Campylobacter, F+ coliphages, and bacterial indicators were isolated from Talbert Marsh
      seagull feces and/or estuarine waters. Genotypic methods, including PCR, RT-PCR, reverse line
      blot hybridization, PFGE, and nucleotide and amino acid sequencing, were employed on subsets
      of frozen suspensions of isolates for further characterization and to determine genetic
      relatedness. There is some limited evidence supporting the idea that seagull feces deposited
      on the sandflats of Talbert Marsh did impact the surrounding estuarine waters. A subset of
      isolates were relatively similar in both nucleotide and amino acid sequence and therefore may
      have come from the same population. Overall however, it is unlikely that pathogens from
      seagull feces in Talbert Marsh pose a significant health risk to swimmers in the ocean waters
      at Huntington Beach. Multiple adverse health outcomes have been linked to exposure to marine
      recreational water of poor microbiologic quality and identifying sources of fecal
      contamination as human or animal in origin is becoming a more important tool in decision
      making to manage fecal contamination of these waters.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Heparan sulfate (HS) is a linear, heterogeneously sulfated polysaccharide that is
      ubiquitous to most mammalian tissues. The roles played by HS on the cell surface and in the
      extracellular matrix (ECM) are diverse in function. A number of HS/protein interactions have
      been studied and have led to a more detailed understanding of signal transduction pathways,
      enzyme activation, and ligand presentation. Accumulating evidence has supported the role of
      the fine structure of HS in high-affinity interactions with serine protease inhibitors, growth
      factors, and microbial coat proteins. These findings have led to a great deal of interest in
      understanding how specific HS structures are generated and the mechanisms that regulate HS
      biosynthesis. Complex HS sequences are generated by a number of biosynthetic enzyme families,
      including the N-deacteylase N-sulfotransferases, epimerase, 2-O-, 6-O-, and
      3-Osulfotransferases. Herein, studies are presented that explore the functions of
      N-deacetylase N-sulfotransferase and the 3-O-sulfotransferases. In addition, we report a
      chemoenzymatic approach to synthesizing anticoagulant heparin, a structural analogue of HS.
      The anticoagulant effects of heparin, derived from natural sources, have been exploited in the
      clinic for over seventy years. A synthetic approach to heparin production could provide the
      anticoagulant with reduced side effects. It would also allow for the investigation of other
      therapeutic benefits of heparin and HS. In conclusion, the work presented herein provides
      detail into the biosynthetic machinery and biological properties of HS, as well as strategies
      to control the assembly of heparin and HS polysaccharides.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In many biomedical studies, the observed data may violate the assumptions of standard
      parametric methods. In these situations, Bayesian methods are appealing since nonparametric
      priors, such as the Dirichlet process (DP), can incorporate a priori knowledge regarding the
      shape or location of an unknown distribution and exact inferences are available using Markov
      chain Monte Carlo methods. Despite the promise of Bayesian nonparametric methods, computation
      can be difficult under large sample sizes. In addition, there is a paucity of methods for
      multiple event time data and for testing across multiple groups. In this dissertation, we
      propose three methods which address important computational, modelling, and testing issues in
      Bayesian nonparametrics. Our first method is a computationally simple approach to fitting
      Bayesian semiparametric random effects models to large longitudinal data sets. Our approach
      involves fitting a model to a smaller set of pseudo-data, which is constructed using expert
      opinion. The research was motivated by data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project, which
      was a prospective epidemiology study consisting of over 30,000 children. We next develop a
      dynamic frailty model which accounts for age-dependent changes in susceptibility to a repeated
      health event, such as the occurrence of new tumors. Our model generalizes the traditional
      shared frailty model for multiple event time data to accommodate smooth, time dependent trends
      in the frailty, baseline hazard, and covariate effects. We also relax our assumptions on the
      frailty using DP priors. Lastly, we present a Bayesian nonparametric method for testing for
      changes in a response distribution with an ordinal predictor. The research was motivated by
      data from toxicology studies, in which dose may affect both the shape and location of the
      response distribution. Using a generalization of the dynamic mixture of DPs (Dunson, 2006,
      Biostatistics, to appear), we test for equivalence in the unknown distribution across dose
      groups and estimate threshold doses. Our method accommodates multivariate responses without
      complication.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Cyclin D1 and cullin4 (CUL4) are two proteins known to be upregulated in cancer.
      Cyclin D1 functions to regulate the cell division cycle and cell growth, while CUL4 assembles
      E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes that function to ubiquitinate target proteins, often marking
      them for degradation. However, the downstream effectors of their oncogenic activities are not
      fully characterized. Therefore, the aim of this study was to discover novel targets of the
      D-type cyclins and of CUL4, and to better describe the E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes assembled
      by CUL4. We identified the TSC1- TSC2 tumor suppressor complex, a key negative regulator of
      cell growth, as a cyclin D-interacting complex, and demonstrated that D-type cyclins could
      down-regulate the activity of TSC1-TSC2 by both CDK (Cyclin Dependent Kinase) -dependent and
      -independent mechanisms. In a separate line of studies, I conducted a genetic analysis of
      mutants of Cul4 and one of its putative substrate receptor molecules, Ddb1 (Damaged DNA
      Binding protein 1) in Drosophila, and established that CUL4DDB1 plays an essential role in
      cell growth, proliferation, and development. These studies suggested a number of novel
      substrates of the CUL4DDB1 ligase, and also served to clarify the role of CUL4DDB1 in

               <mods:abstract>Tylophorine and related phenanthroindolizidine alkaloids isolated principally from
      Asclepiadaceae have been targets of synthetic modification because of their profound cytotoxic
      antitumor activity. As part of our interest in plant-derived antitumor agents, novel
      water-soluble phenanthrene-based tylophorine derivatives (PBTs) were designed, synthesized and
      evaluated for anticancer activity. Several PBTs showed superior activity profiles with EC50
      values in the sub-micromolar range, which are comparable to those of currently used antitumor
      drugs. A structure-activity relationship (SAR) study was also explored to facilitate the
      further development of this new compound class. Subsequently, C9-substituted PBTs were
      designed and synthesized using 2, 3 methylenedioxy-6-methoxyphenanthrene as a common skeleton
      based on our prior SAR findings. The C-9 site is an ideal position for introducing more polar,
      water-solubility-enhancing moieties. We also extended the in vitro antitumor screening to
      include additional significant tumor types [A549 (lung), DU-145 (prostate), ZR-751 (breast),
      KB (nasopharyngeal)] as well as a multi-drug resistant cancer cell subline [KB-Vin (multi-drug
      resistant KB subline)]. Most of the compounds showed fairly uniform and potent cytotoxic
      activity with EC50 approximately equal to10-7 M against both wild type and matched multi-drug
      resistant KB cell lines, and displayed notable selectivity toward DU-145 (prostate) and ZR-751
      (breast) cancer cell lines. A combination of QSAR modeling and database mining was used to
      facilitate further design and discovery of novel anticancer PBTs. MolConnZ 2D topological
      descriptors were applied to a dataset of 52 chemically diverse PBTs and variable selection
      models were generated using the kappa nearest neighbor (kappa-NN) method. The derived kappa-NN
      QSAR models have high internal accuracy, with leave-one-out cross-validated R2 (q2) values
      ranging between 0.6 and 0.8. The original dataset was then divided into several training and
      test sets to provide highly predictive models with q2 values greater than 0.5 for the training
      sets and R2 values greater than 0.6 for the test sets. The ten best models were capable of
      mining the commercially available ChemDiv Database (450,000 compounds) and resulted in 34
      consensus hits. Of these 34 compounds, 10 compounds were tested and 8 were confirmed to be
      active with a best EC50 of 1.8 ?M. These models were further validated by predicting the
      activity of four new PBTs compounds with reasonable accuracy and 11 consensuses hits with R2
      of 0.52. These results indicate that this approach can be successfully applied to further
      design and discovery of anticancer drug candidates from this compound class.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study evaluated the technique errors of full mouth series exposed with two
      intraoral radiography receptor systems; traditional film-based and PSP-based (photostimulable
      phosphor) receptors. Full mouth series (n=405) were randomly selected: three series per each
      student for film-based (n=81) and PSP-based (n=102). All images (1514 film and 1754 PSP
      images) were evaluated in four categories for technique errors: 1) horizontal, 2) vertical, 3)
      cone centering, 4) packet placement. Each image was graded based on the presence and degree of
      the error (no error, diagnostically acceptable error and diagnostically unacceptable). All
      images were evaluated using the same viewing conditions: viewbox for film images and a
      17" computer monitor for digital images at (1024 x 768 resolution) with no feature
      enhancements. More technique errors occurred with the use of the PSP receptors when compared
      to film (p&lt;0.05). Further research should explore use of the PSP receptor with another
      film holding device.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Dermal exposure to Jet-Propulsion Fuel 8 (JP-8) is prevalent in the United States Air
      Force. Although a large amount of exposure data was generated from previous occupational
      studies, dermal exposure to JP-8 was poorly characterized and quantitative estimates of the
      contribution of dermal exposure to the internal dose of JP-8 were unavailable. To fill this
      data and knowledge gap, a controlled dermal exposure study was designed to quantify the
      toxicokinetic behavior of naphthalene, 1-methyl naphthalene, 2-methyl naphthalene, decane,
      undecane, and dodecane. Further, a toxicokinetic model was constructed; this model provided
      the basis for the development of a physiologically-based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model of dermal
      and inhalation exposure to JP-8. The PBTK model was used to quantify the contribution of
      dermal exposure to the internal dose of naphthalene. Results of this research suggest that the
      apparent human permeability coefficient is 10- fold lower than estimates made in vitro.
      Further, simulations of dermal exposure to JP-8 suggested that the tape-strip method can be
      used to differentiate exposure groups in epidemiology studies. The median relative
      contribution of dermal exposure to the internal dose of naphthalene was 1.7% (10th percentile
      = 0.3% and 90th percentile = 6.9%). The overall implication of these findings is that
      protection from dermal exposure to JP-8 can reduce the internal dose of naphthalene. However,
      for most of the US Air Force personnel, the major contribution to the internal dose was from
      inhalation exposure. The two most significant contributions to the scientific understanding of
      JP-8 exposures were (1) improved characterization of dermal exposures, and (2) quantitation of
      the toxicokinetic behavior of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Overall, this research has
      presented a new direction for toxicokinetic modeling human exposures to complex chemical
      mixtures. This modeling strategy may be used to better assess the risks associated with JP-8
      exposures in human populations.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>DNA damage and replication checkpoints are signal transduction pathways that provide
      constant surveillance to maintain genome integrity. Checkpoints control a variety of cellular
      responses including DNA repair, chromatin remodeling and gene transcription. Claspin is an
      essential protein for the ATR-dependent activation of the DNA replication checkpoint response
      in Xenopus and human cells. The presence of stalled replication forks leads to phosphorylation
      of Claspin in both of the organisms and phosphorylated Claspin interacts with Chk1 and this
      interaction is essential for phosphorylation of Chk1 and checkpoint activation. Here we
      describe the purification and characterization of human Claspin. The protein has a ring-like
      structure and binds with high affinity to branched DNA molecules. These findings suggest that
      Claspin may be a component of the replication ensemble and plays a role in the replication
      checkpoint by directly associating with replication forks and with the various branched DNA
      structures likely to form at stalled replication forks due to DNA damage. In addition, we
      analyzed the importance of Claspin DNA binding for Chk1 activation by testing whether Claspin
      recruits Chk1 to DNA. These studies led to identification of Chk1 DNA binding activity. Chk1
      possesses low DNA binding affinity to certain branched DNA structures and Claspin does not
      recruit Chk1 to DNA.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Biliary excretion is an important route of hepatic elimination of drugs and
      metabolites that is investigated commonly using in vitro or in vivo animal models. However,
      changes in biliary clearance due to drug-drug interactions, genetic polymorphisms and/or
      disease state may be species-specific, and animal data may be difficult to extrapolate to
      humans. This dissertation research focused on the development and refinement of a specialized
      clinical protocol and novel oroenteric tube to accurately quantify biliary clearance of drugs
      in humans and the comparison of these values with predicted biliary clearance values
      determined in sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes. Hepatocytes cultured between two layers of
      extracellular matrix express and correctly localize functional transport proteins on the
      canalicular as well as the basolateral domains, and enable determination of drug excretion
      into bile by quantifying accumulation within the hepatocyte and bile canalicular networks.
      Experiments were devised and performed to establish the utility of this model to predict
      hepatobiliary drug disposition in humans. The biliary clearance of three model probes, Tc-99m
      mebrofenin, Tc-99m sestamibi, and piperacillin, was evaluated in healthy humans. These model
      compounds exhibited high, intermediate and low biliary clearance, respectively.
      Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations of the disposition of Tc-99m mebrofenin in humans,
      combined with results of in vitro systems transfected with hepatic transport proteins,
      revealed that disease states and drug interactions would impact the hepatobiliary disposition
      of this probe. Moreover, the recovery of piperacillin metabolites in bile samples obtained
      during the clinical studies suggested that the clinical methodology developed is useful for
      the identification of metabolites unique to the human species. Finally, the biliary clearance
      values obtained in vivo were compared to those calculated using sandwich-cultured human
      hepatocytes. The in vitro system proved to be a reliable model for predicting biliary
      clearance of xenobiotics in humans. Collectively, the results of this research provide new
      tools, both in vivo and in vitro, to study and characterize biliary clearance of drugs in the
      most relevant species, humans.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) control the cellular concentration of
      "second messengers" adenosine or guanosine 3´, 5´-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP
      or cGMP). All PDEs contain a conserved catalytic domain, but each family possesses different
      substrate specificity and selective inhibitors. Selective inhibitors of PDEs have been studied
      as therapeutic agents for various diseases. However, many essential questions about the
      structure and function of PDEs remain mysteries. This dissertation will focus on inhibitor
      selectivity and substrate specificity studies of PDEs by X-ray crystallography, mutageneisis
      and enzymology. The crystal structure of PDE7 and kinetic analysis revealed multiple elements
      that jointly determinate inhibitor selectivity of PDEs. Crystal structures of PDE5 in complex
      with inhibitors showed multiple conformations of PDE5, providing insights into the enzyme
      function and for drug development. Crystal structures of PDE10 and structures of PDE4
      subfamilies in complex with a PDE4D selective inhibitor will provide insights into the
      substrate specificity and subfamily inhibitor selectivity.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Colon cancer is the third most common cancer in people, and early diagnosis is
      critical to survival. This study investigates the efficacy of using metabolomic technology in
      diagnosing colon cancer in a mouse model. Urine from a genetically defined population of mice
      was analyzed by NMR spectrometry, after carcinogen exposure and categorization for tumor
      development based on histological examination. The NMR spectra were then analyzed by
      statistical methods of classification to determine if colon tumors result in changes to the
      metabolites secreted in urine that can be detected by NMR spectrometry. Different statistical
      analyses were also compared to determine which is most effective at retrieving information
      from the NMR data. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a popular analysis for metabolomic
      data, is ineffective on this data set. Support Vector Machine (SVM) reveals six significant
      components, which when entered into PCA results in clear separation of normal and
      tumor-bearing mice.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Protein quality control is essential for living cells to maintain homeostasis during
      normal growth conditions as well as upon stress challenges. Molecular chaperones and the
      ubiquitin-proteasome system are the two arms of the cellular protein quality control system.
      CHIP is an Hsp70/Hsp90 cochaperone that inhibits ATPase activity of chaperones and enhances
      protein folding in vivo. CHIP is also a chaperone-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase that diverts
      chaperone substrates to the proteasome. Therefore, CHIP regulates both arms of the protein
      quality control system. My studies have established that CHIP regulates the stress-chaperone
      response through induced trimerization and transcriptional activation of HSF1, which leads to
      transcriptional upregulation of heat shock proteins. This upregulation is required for cells
      to cope with stress as CHIP (-/-) murine fibroblasts have decreased viability and increased
      apoptosis after heat shock or protein damaging agent treatment. Activation of HSF1 by CHIP is
      essential for the cells to cope with stress challenges. E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP
      has been implicated in the degradation of a variety of chaperone-bound cytoplasmic proteins.
      Using a proteomics approach, we have identified BAG2 as a common component of CHIP
      holocomplexes in vivo. Binding assays indicate that BAG2 associates with CHIP as part of a
      ternary complex with Hsc70. BAG2 is an efficient and specific inhibitor of CHIP-dependent
      ubiquitin ligase activity. This activity is due, in part, to inhibition of interactions
      between CHIP and its cognate ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UbcH5a. The association of BAG2
      with CHIP provides a cochaperone-dependent regulatory mechanism for preventing unregulated
      ubiquitylation of misfolded proteins by CHIP. Taken together, my work has established the
      mechanism of CHIP to regulate the stress response and identified a regulatory factor for its
      E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Cells of the nervous tissue that preserve the capacity to divide and differentiate in
      neurons and glia are defined as neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Within central nervous system
      (CNS) the NPCs express SOX2, a protein of SoxB1 subgroup of HMG-box superfamily of
      transcription factors. To address function of SOX2 in vivo we used gene targeting in embryonic
      stem cells to engineer a conditional null (Sox2cond) and two hypomorphic (Sox2IR and Sox2lP)
      alleles of the mouse gene. Sox2cond allows removal of the SOX2 coding sequence using CRE
      recombinase while Sox2IR and Sox2lP alleles sustain gene expression at 20-40% and 15-30%,
      respectively, of the level in wild-type mice. To address the development of NPCs in vivo we
      focused on mouse retina, an essential part of the vision system. As an isolated and
      well-defined structure of CNS, retina became a well-characterized model for studies of
      molecular mechanisms of neurogenesis. Conditional ablation of Sox2 in the mouse retina results
      in the complete loss of neural progenitor competence, so that Sox2-null cells do not
      contribute to the dividing progenitor population and do not differentiate into neurons or
      glia. Lowering the levels of Sox2 expression below 50%, achieved in compound hypomorphic-null
      animals restricts the capacity of retinal NPCs, resulting in aberrant neuronal differentiation
      evident from disruption of retinal nuclear laminas and malformed neuritic connections. Our
      findings demonstrate furthermore that SOX2 activity has wide effect on gene expression. In
      particular it is required for expression of proneural genes and, in a concentration dependent
      manner, Notch pathway genes in retinal progenitors. Collectively, these studies reveal an
      essential dosage-sensitive regulation of neural progenitor competence by SOX2. We show here
      that SOX2 is uniquely required for mouse retina development. SOX2 is mutated in about 10% of
      anophthalmia or severe microphthalmia cases in humans (Fantes, Ragge et al. 2003). The current
      study demonstrates a similar phenotype in Sox2 mutant mice, hence, supplying a mouse model for
      the analysis of developmental defects in SOX2 anophthalmia syndrome.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Newborn screening for inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) can help prevent or reduce
      mortality and morbidity through timely identification and subsequent treatment. North Carolina
      (NC) uses tandem mass spectrometry to screen newborns for over 25 IEM. This dissertation is
      divided into three parts. The first part examined follow-up procedures and compliance in
      submitting a repeat screen among NC newborns with a borderline abnormal initial newborn
      screening result. Data was drawn from linking newborn screening records with birth
      certificate, census and health professions data. No repeat screen was submitted for
      approximately 9% of these infants. Using logistic regression analysis adjusted for clustering,
      infants who were Hispanic, black, living in a neighborhood with a low socio-economic index,
      and whose families did not receive a sent notification letter were less likely to have a
      repeat screen submitted. The second part surveyed pediatricians of the NC Pediatric Society to
      explore pediatricians' knowledge of NC newborn screening policies, their clinical protocol for
      handling results and their personal beliefs about the utility of newborn screening. About half
      of participants ranked themselves in the lower ranges of level of knowledge and comfort in
      communicating screening results. Only 57% of pediatricians correctly answered over half of the
      questions relating to newborn screening and state policies. Among those in clinical practice,
      15% of pediatricians assumed that results were normal when they had not received a screening
      result and 32% did not provide families with normal screening results. The third part examined
      risk factors for transient neonatal tyrosinemia (TNT), abnormal elevations in tyrosine during
      the neonatal period that resolve in time. Using logistic regression analysis, infants who were
      premature, small-for-gestational-age, breast-fed or Hispanic were found to be at higher risk
      for TNT. Overall, these findings suggest that: 1-follow-up strategies need to address ways to
      improve rates of repeat screen submission, 2- further education is needed for pediatricians
      about newborn screening and its related policies, and 3- the number of false positive screens
      for inborn errors of tyrosine metabolism may be reduced by the consideration of gestational
      age, type of feeding and ethnic group.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is an important regulatory protein that integrates signals
      from integrins and growth factor receptors to control cell growth, survival, and migration.
      FAK function is tightly regulated and the complete mechanism of activation remains to be
      resolved. The FAT domain of FAK associates with the scaffolding protein paxillin as a major
      mechanism of FAK localization. Structural insights have been used to design point mutations to
      disrupt FAK binding to paxillin and resulting defects in FAK function have been characterized.
      The FERM domain of FAK is tho ught to play an important role in relaying biological signals.
      This domain is involved in an intramolecular interaction with the FAK catalytic domain that
      severely inhibits activity. I hypothesize that FERM domain associations disrupt the inhibitory
      association between the FERM and catalytic domains, thus activating FAK. A mutagenesis
      strategy has been used to identify binding sites on the FERM domain.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro and in vivo effects of several
      prototypical inducers, namely -naphthoflavone, 3-methylcholanthrene, phenobarbital, isoniazid,
      rifampin, and clofibric acid, on the expression of cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes in beagle
      dogs. For the in vitro induction study, primary cultures of dog hepatocytes were treated with
      enzyme inducers for 3 days, after which microsomes were prepared and analyzed for P450
      activities. For the in vivo induction study, male and female beagle dogs were treated with
      enzyme inducers for 4 days (with the exception of phenobarbital, which was given for 14 days),
      after which the livers were removed and microsomal P450 activities were determined ex vivo.
      Treatment of male beagle dog hepatocyte cultures (n = 3) with -naphthoflavone or
      3-methlychloranthrene resulted in up to a 75-fold increase in microsomal 7-ethoxyresorufin
      O-dealkylase (CYP1A1/2) activity, whereas in vivo treatment of male and female beagle dogs
      with -naphthoflavone followed by ex vivo analysis resulted in up to a 24-fold increase.
      Phenobarbital caused a 13-fold increase in 7-benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylase (CYP2B11)
      activity in vitro and up to a 9.9- fold increase in vivo. Isoniazid had little or no effect on
      4-nitrophenol hydroxylase (CYP2E1) activity in vitro. Rifampin caused a 13-fold induction of
      testosterone 6 - hydroxylase (CYP3A12) activity in vitro and up to a 4.5-fold increase in
      vivo. Treatment of dogs in vivo or dog hepatocytes in vitro with clofibric acid appeared to
      have no effect on CYP4A activity as determined by the 12-hydroxylation of lauric acid. In
      general, the absolute rates (picomoles per minute per milligram of microsomal protein) of P450
      reactions catalyzed by microsomes from cultured hepatocytes (i.e., in vitro rates) were
      considerably lower than those catalyzed by microsomes from dog liver (i.e., ex vivo rates).
      These results 40 suggest that beagle dogs have CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP2E, and CYP3A enzymes and that
      the induction profile resembles the profile observed in humans more than in rats. (Abstract
      from Chapter 2) Compared to other species, little information is available on the
      xenobiotic-induced regulation of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the beagle dog. Dogs are widely
      used in the pharmaceutical industry for many study types, including those that will impact
      decisions on compound progression. The purpose of this study was 1) to determine the temporal
      kinetics of drug-induced changes in canine CYP1A, CYP2B, and CYP3A mRNA and enzymatic
      activity, and 2) to characterize concentration-response relationships for CYP1A2, 2B11 and
      3A12 using primary cultures of canine hepatocytes treated with -naphthoflavone (BNF),
      Phenobarbital (PB) and Rifampin (RIF), respectively. CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNA exhibited maximal
      expression (12,700-fold and 206-fold, respectively) after 36 hr of treatment with BNF. PB
      treatment, but not RIF treatment, caused maximal induction of CYP2B11 mRNA (149-fold) after 48
      hr of treatment. CYP3A12 and CYP3A26 mRNA levels were increased maximally after 72 hr of
      treatment with PB and RIF (CYP3A12, 35- fold and 18-fold, CYP3A26, 72-fold and 22-fold with PB
      and RIF treatment, respectively). Concentration-response relationships for BNF induced
      7-ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylation (EROD) (EC50=7.8 4.2 mu-M), PB induced 7-benzyloxyresorufin
      O-dealkylation (BROD) (EC50=123 30 mu-M) and PB and RIF induced testosterone 6 -hydroxylation
      (EC50=132 28 ?M and EC50=0.98 0.16 ?M) resembled the relationship for human CYP induction
      compared to that of rodent. Interestingly, RIF had no effect on CYP2B11 expression, which
      represents a species difference overlooked in previous investigations. Overall, the induction
      of dog CYP1A, CYP2B and CYP3A exhibits characteristics that are intermediate to those of
      rodent and human. (Abstract from Chapter 3) In addition to its function as a fatty acid
      hydroxylase the peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (PPAR ) target gene, CYP4A, has been
      shown to be important in conversion of arachidonic acid to the potent vasoconstrictor
      20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), suggesting a role for this enzyme in mediating
      vascular tone. In the present study the cDNA sequence of beagle dog CYP4A37, CYP4A38 and
      CYP4A39 from liver was determined. Open reading frame analysis predicted that CYP4A37, CYP4A38
      and CYP4A39 are each comprised of 510 amino acids with ~90% sequence homology, and ~71% and
      ~78% homology to rat CYP4A1 and human CYP4A11, respectively. PCR analysis revealed that the
      three dog CYP4A isoforms are expressed in
      kidney&gt;liver&gt;&gt;lung&gt;&gt;intestine&gt;skeletal
      muscle&gt;heart. Treatment of primary dog hepatocytes with the PPAR agonists GW7647X and
      clofibric acid resulted in an increase in CYP4A37, CYP4A38 and CYP4A39 mRNA expression (up to
      4-fold), whereas HMG-CoA synthase mRNA expression was increased to a greater extent (up to
      10-fold). These results suggest that dog CYP4A37, CYP4A38 and CYP4A39 are expressed in a
      tissue dependent manner and that beagle dog CYP4A is not highly inducible by PPAR agonists,
      similar to the human CYP4A11 gene. (Abstract from Chapter 4)</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Intraoral preparation of zirconia implant abutments creates deep surface defects
      making abutments susceptible to fracture during loading. Fracture strengths were tested for
      (1) HIP-processed zirconia bars (Astra-Tech) after preparation and/or surface repair
      treatments: no preparation (NP), dry-preparation (DP), wet-preparation (WP), or wetpreparation
      and 30d water storage (WP+30d), mitigating treatment of bonding agent (WP+B), sandblasting
      (WP+SB), or polishing (WP+P), and (2) abutment-assemblies (preparations of 0, 0.5, or 1mm
      margin reduction). NP established the strength for pristine zirconia bars (1634 plus or minus
      95MPa). DP (1144 plus or minus 109MPa), WP (1442 plus or minus 89MPa), WP+30d (1193 plus or
      minus155MPa), and WP+B (1218 plus or minus 77MPa) groups had significantly (p less than or
      equal to 0.05) reduced strengths. WP+SB (1632 plus or minus 134MPa) or WP+P (1664 plus or
      minus 176MPa) repairs equally well recovered original strengths (p&lt;0.001). There were
      no statistically significant differences (p&gt;0.05) among different abutmentassembly
      groups and no logical relationship of strength to increasing amount of reduction. All
      fractures occurred at the interface where the abutment was connected to the analog, suggesting
      that fracture was unrelated to the actual abutment.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Purpose: to examine ability of collagen solution (CS) to aid revascularization of
      necrotic infected root canals in immature dog teeth. Sixty immature teeth (6 dogs) were
      infected, disinfected and randomized into experimental groups: 1: no further treatment; 2:
      blood in canal; 3: CS in canal; 4: CS+blood; 5: negative controls (natural development).
      Uncorrected Chi-squared analysis of radiographic results showed no statistical differences (p
      greater than or eqal to 0.05) between experimental groups regarding healing of radiolucencies
      or radicular thickening; however, group 2 showed significantly more apical closure than group
      1 (p=0.01). There were no statistical differences between experimental groups for histological
      results. Groups 1-4 (previously infected) showed positive radiographic outcomes (thickened
      walls in 35.4%, apical closure in 54.9%, healing radiolucencies in 65.9%) and histologic
      outcomes (thickened walls in 43.9%, apical closure in 54.9%, new luminal tissue in 29.3%). A
      collagen solution did not aid revascularization of disinfected immature dog root canal
      systems, but revascularization is possible.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The Diffraction Enhanced Imaging (DEI) method is a novel x-ray imaging technique that
      dramatically extends the capability of conventional x-ray imaging. X-ray imaging has
      traditionally been dependent on x-ray absorption to generate contrast, and is the physical
      mechanism of contrast in planar x-ray imaging and computed tomography. DEI utilizes the Bragg
      peak of perfect crystal diffraction to convert angular changes into intensity changes,
      providing a large change in intensity for a small change in angle. The use of a silicon
      analyzer crystal in the path of the x-ray beam generates two additional forms of image
      contrast, refraction and extinction. Objects that have very little absorption contrast may
      have considerable refraction and extinction contrast, this improving visualization and
      extending the utility of x-ray imaging. An area of medicine where this technique could have a
      dramatic impact is in breast imaging, where the key diagnostic structures often have low
      absorption contrast, especially in the early stages of disease. In order to develop a DEI
      clinical prototype imaging system, a systematic assessment of the engineering parameters for
      the breast imaging application must be determined. This body of work investigates the primary
      imaging parameters of DEI (x-ray beam energy, crystal reflections, angular sampling) and
      demonstrates how the unique properties of DEI can be capitalized upon to address the
      engineering limitations of flux, dramatically reducing the dose required for imaging. The
      results from this analysis are used to describe a plausible design for a non-synchrotron based
      DEI breast imaging system.</mods:abstract>

      Dentistry, Department of Endodontics. A total of 49 patients returned for follow up (N= 55
      teeth). Healing was assessed radiographically using two methods: the Periapical Index (PAI)
      and a Clinical Impression of Healing (CIH). Overall, favorable healing was found in 69% (PAI)
      and 90.3% (CIH) of teeth. Of the independent variables assessed, only patient history of
      tobacco use significantly affected healing in the presence of a preoperative periapical lesion
      (Chi Square=4.27; p=0.038) although clear differences in healing emerged based on patient
      diabetic status. Conclusion: Teeth with chronic apical periodontitis treated close to the
      radiographic apex, with adequate apical enlargement, and with calcium hydroxide as an
      interappointment, intra-canal medicament had a success rate comparable to outcomes reported in
      the endodontic literature.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>HIV-associated salivary gland disease (HIV SGD) is an AIDS defining condition
      associated with significant morbidity and lymphoma development in HIV-positive individuals.
      Understanding HIV SGD becomes increasingly important as the burden of HIV disease expands
      globally. The epidemiology of HIV SGD suggests the involvement of a viral opportunist in its
      pathogenesis. Based on this and on histologic correlates we hypothesized that HIV SGD is a
      manifestation of DNA tumor virus infection/reactivation during immunosuppression. Analysis of
      HIV SGD lesions determined that while herpesviral gene products were not consistently detected
      in HIV SGD, polyomavirus nucleic acids and antigens were detected. The subcellular
      localization of the viral-oncoprotein in HIV SGD was similar to that in a mouse model of
      polyomavirus-associated salivary gland disease. In HIV SGD the polyomavirus oncoprotein,
      T-antigen, was consistently co-localized with p53 implicating the deregulation of this tumor
      suppressor in the HIV SGD pathogenesis. Collectively, these studies underscore the potential
      for polyomaviruses to be key etiologic agents in HIV SGD development.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Tooth movement rates can be inhibited by prostaglandin inhibitors acting systemically.
      We investigated the locally delivered effects of ketorolac tromethamine (KT), a potent
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), on orthodontic tooth movements in twelve Wistar
      rats. U-shaped expansion springs were positioned between upper first molars exerting equal and
      reciprocal, laterally directed forces for seventeen days. Every fourth day 1.5 mg of KT in
      solution was delivered around one molar and saline solution was injected adjacent to the
      contralateral molar. Subsequent to a wash-out period lasting fifteen days of continued
      expansion, the appliances were removed, the teeth allowed to relapse for thirteen days while
      the same schedule was maintained for the NSAID delivery. Combining the data from all the teeth
      that received KT and comparing those with the control data, no significant differences were
      seen with their movements during the expansion or relapse phases.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The present investigations focus on the development of an antibody-based (IgG)
      endogenous drug delivery system for the systemic delivery of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides
      (CpG-ODNs) in the immunotherapeutic treatment of solid tumors. Four fundamental observations
      support this research: (i) current CpG-ODN immunotherapeutic regimens require frequent
      intra/peritumoral(local) injections, restricting their application to external solid tumors
      only, (ii) endogenous IgG and monomeric immune complexes (1:1 stoichiometry) have a long
      circulation half-life, slow clearance, low volume of tissue distribution, and passively
      extravasate into the tumor periphery via the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect,
      (iii) the cellular targets for CpG-ODN are peritumoral dendritic cells and macrophages, which
      highly express Fc= receptors. These receptors endocytose IgG and monomeric immune complexes
      via their Fc portion, and (iv) the molecular receptor for CpG-ODN, TLR 9, is located inside
      the endosome. To this end, the binding affinity of model ODNs to antidinitrophenyl (DNP) IgG
      was optimized through the strategic derivatization of DNP epitopes (Chapter II). The premise
      behind this study was to obtain the highest affinity iv complex between DNP-ODNs and anti-DNP
      IgG, as to prevent ODN systemic dissociation. Accordingly, the chosen bivalent design yielded
      a 66-fold enhancement in binding affinity and was used to derivatize CpG-ODNs for in vivo
      studies. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and biodistribution analysis of bivalent, monovalent, and
      underivatized immunotherapeutic CpG oligodeoxynucleotides in a DNP-immunized, syngeneic
      tumor-bearing mouse model ensued (Chapter III). The prolonged half-life, reduced volume of
      distribution, slowed systemic clearance, and enhanced tumor accumulation observed during this
      investigation for both monovalent and bivalent DNPCpG- ODNs warranted further pharmacodynamic
      studies (Chapter IV). In this case, however, only the monovalent conjugate was tested for its
      ability to inhibit tumor growth in the same animal model. Its physiological effect was also
      assessed through gross physiological observation and histological analysis of lymphoid organs
      (liver and spleen) and solid tumors. As expected, the systemic disposition profile of
      DNP-CpG-ODN observed during PK studies correlated to an enhanced therapeutic efficacy as this
      formulation inhibited the growth of solid tumors and elicited necrosis of tumoral tissue. All
      together, these findings attest to the validity of this drug delivery approach for the
      targeted systemic immunotherapeutic treatment of solid tumors.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Risk-based regulatory decisions generally apply a margin of safety meant to guard
      against underestimation of risk in the face of inter-subject variability and uncertainty.
      Since these two components often are unknown or only vaguely characterized, the decisions
      involved usually employ conservative default assumptions concerning the margin of safety,
      resulting in regulatory limits that may be more (or less) health protective than necessary if
      variability and uncertainty could be characterized probabilistically. As a result, it remains
      impossible in most cases to determine the degree of protectiveness inherent in a standard. The
      debate about maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) of arsenic is an example. At present, we can
      only get a vague idea that lowering MCLs results in larger margins of safety, but at the
      expense of greater compliance costs. If the magnitude of this margin of safety is not taken
      into account, it is possible that an MCL may be established based on a significantly larger
      margin of safety than is necessary, reasonable or consistent with that applied to other
      contaminants. Thus an unnecessarily expensive treatment policy may be selected. In this study,
      a new framework of probabilistic risk-based decision making was developed. A meta-analysis was
      conducted for arsenic in drinking water by combining several epidemiological studies from
      various regions (such as Taiwan, US, Argentina, Chile and Finland). Then the results of the
      meta-analysis were incorporated into the framework to characterize the margin of safety
      through variability and uncertainty analyses. The final product of this study is a method of
      probabilistic risk assessment that better deals with variability and uncertainty issues. This
      risk assessment methodology can help decision-makers make optimal determinations on regulatory
      limits for a contaminant that adequately protect human health with an ample margin of safety
      at a more reasonable cost than currently is the case.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Health promotion interventions among the underserved should address communitylevel
      barriers to healthy behaviors, as it is likely that such barriers exacerbate health
      disparities. This study employed qualitative and quantitative research methodology to examine
      intrapersonal and environmental factors related to use of nutrition and physical activity
      community resources among underserved women. Qualitative interviews were conducted to develop
      a conceptual framework describing influences on food choice in specific food environments. Key
      environmental influences on food choice were: (1) urban and rural differences in access to
      community food sources; and (2) the importance of the community nutrition environment
      surrounding work. At the intrapersonal level, food choices were influenced by women's desires
      to (1) provide healthy food for children and (2) prevent or manage disease. These data were
      also used to develop theory-informed community resource intervention tools, designed to
      enhance the ability of women to identify and address community barriers and resources. The
      newly developed community resource intervention tools were used in a randomized intervention
      trial of a cardiovascular disease risk reduction program for underinsured, midlife women (n =
      236). In order to evaluate the impact of the community resource intervention tools, mediation
      analyses were conducted. In urban women, there was a iii significant intervention effect on
      self-reported use of nutrition resources. The effect on selfreported use of physical activity
      resources approached statistical significance. Self-efficacy for accessing resources was not a
      mediator, while knowledge was a potential mediator of the intervention effect on use of
      physical activity resources. To further examine the relationship between intrapersonal and
      environmental factors, the correlation between perceived and objectively measured access to
      physical activity resources was examined, revealing slight to moderate correlations.
      Cross-sectional analyses between objectively measured moderate to vigorous physical activity
      and perceived and objectively measured access to physical activity resources showed
      statistically significant associations between activity and (a) perceived distance to gyms,
      and (b) objectively measured number of schools in a 1-mile radius of participants' homes.
      Taken together, this research supports the importance of addressing both intrapersonal and
      environmental factors related to the use of community resources when designing future
      interventions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Uterine leiomyomata, or fibroids, are one of the most common neoplasms in women of
      reproductive age. They occur more often and are larger in African American women compared to
      White women. Although benign, the etiology of fibroids is largely unknown, however they are
      hormonally dependent. The biologic effect of estrogen is influenced by estrogen metabolism;
      therefore estrogen metabolism enzymes may influence fibroid development. Cytochrome P-450 1A1
      (CYP1A1), Cytochrome P-450 1B1 (CYP1B1), and Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) are
      polymorphic genes that encode key enzymes in the estrogen metabolism pathway. Four single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of CYP1A1, 2 SNPs of CYP1B1, and 1 SNP of COMT were evaluated
      for associations with fibroid prevalence and size in a cross-sectional sample of premenopausal
      African American (n=583) and White (n=404) women from the National Institute of Environmental
      Health Sciences Uterine Fibroid Study. Participants provided DNA samples and completed
      telephone interviews and questionnaires. Race-specific prevalence ratios (PR) and 95%
      confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from log-risk regression models; prevalence
      differences (PD) and 95% CI were estimated from linear-risk regression models. Haplotypes and
      diplotypes were inferred for CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. Genotype distributions varied by race. African
      Americans were more likely to have fibroids (72% vs 50%) and to have large fibroids (24% vs
      11%) than Whites. The CYP1A1*3allele was associated with fibroids among African Americans
      (PR=1.14; 95%CI: 1.02, 1.28; PD=0.10; 95%CI: 0.01, 0.19). The CYP1A1*4 allele was positively
      associated with fibroids among both Whites (PR=1.20; 95%CI: 0.90, 1.61; iv PD=0.10; 95%CI:
      -0.07, 0.27) and African Americans (PR=1.16; 95%CI: 0.92, 1.48; PD=0.12; 95%CI: -0.08, 0.32).
      Haplotypes and diplotypes that included CYP1A1*3 and CYP1A1*4 showed similar results.
      Estimates for CYP1B1 and COMT alleles were close to the null. Analyses of effect measure
      modification by age, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol use, oral contraceptive use, and
      number of fullterm births did not show deviations from additive or multiplicative
      expectations. Our results reveal possible relationships between CYP1A1*3 and *4 polymorphisms
      and fibroid prevalence. These results must be confirmed in other populations, and consider
      additional genes and variants within the estrogen metabolism pathway.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Primary failure of eruption (PFE) is a rare condition that leads to spectacular
      posterior open bites and does not respond to orthodontic treatment. Records from 97 patients
      with posterior open bite were analyzed. Based on key characteristics, subjects were classified
      as having PFE, indeterminate failure of eruption (IFE), and mechanical failure of eruption
      (MFE). Results showed that PFE affects mostly posterior teeth, affects all teeth distal to the
      first affected tooth, often presents with a cleared eruption path that the tooth fails to
      follow, and appears to have two forms. Type I exhibits a similar lack of eruption potential of
      affected teeth, and Type II has a varied eruption potential. This study also supports the
      genetic etiology of PFE which is likely due to a defect in a tooth-specific gene product.
      Differentiation between PFE and ankylosis is key to determining prognosis for orthodontic
      treatment and requires adequate longitudinal data.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Schizophrenia is a severe, debilitating, and complex disease. It is characterized by
      delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and grossly disorganized or catatonic
      behavior. As a complex disease, schizophrenia is thought to be caused by many genes. In
      addition the etiology is thought to be heterogeneous across the population of persons
      suffering from schizophrenia. In an attempt to dissect the heterogeneity of the disease, and
      investigate the role of candidate genes associated with schizophrenia, several studies were
      completed. The first was a case only association study of neurocognition and COMT, a candidate
      gene for schizophrenia. This is the largest study of its kind to date. The second study
      addresses the possibility of predisposition due to differential expression of candidate genes.
      In this study expression of another candidate gene PRODH was assessed. Together these studies
      aimed at investigating the polymorphisms of candidate genes for schizophrenia.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The individual growth curve perspective provided the foundation for a developmental
      framework of maternal identity formation and attainment in a military sample. Data from a
      military study of pregnancy adaptation to birth outcomes provided data for an investigation of
      change over time in conflict for prenatal maternal identity formation, and the impact of
      family adaptability, community support and military deployment on this trajectory. The
      individual slopes and intercepts of maternal identity formation were assessed for 421
      activeduty women and wives of military servicemen in each trimester of pregnancy. Fitting of
      unconditional growth models indicated that significant variation in prenatal Acceptance of
      Pregnancy (ACCPREG) existed across time and rate of change for individuals. No evidence
      existed for significant change in Identification of the Motherhood Role (IDMORO). Significant
      variability existed in the conflict associated with IDMORO between individuals. Fitting of
      conditional growth models for ACCPREG and IDMORO predicted by Family Adaptability (FADAPT) and
      Community Support (SSI) showed that FADAPT and SSI significantly affected the conflict
      associated with ACCPREG and IDMORO, but not the pattern of change over time. First-trimester
      Deployment significantly affected conflict with ACCPREG. The ability of prenatal maternal
      identity formation to predict six-month postpartum maternal identity attainment was assessed
      for 113 women from the original iv sample. Identification of the Motherhood Role significantly
      impacted postpartum Satisfaction with Infant and Infant Care as well as Confidence in
      Motherhood Role and Tasks. Change over time in Family Adaptability and Community Support had
      significant affects on Confidence in Motherhood Role and Tasks. First-trimester Deployment on
      Identification of the Motherhood Role predicted Satisfaction with Infant and Infant Care.
      Prenatal Deployment was not predictive of any change in Confidence in Motherhood Role and
      Tasks. The findings provide information for appropriate timing of interventions to improve
      maternal-fetal and infant attachment and for policies impacting military families. First
      trimester maternal identity formation significantly impacted maternal role satisfaction at
      sixmonths postpartum. First trimester family adaptability and community support both decreased
      conflict associated with maternal identity formation and attainment. In addition, first
      trimester deployment, even with prenatal return from deployment continued to impact maternal
      identity at six-months postpartum.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Rationale: Many people delay health care treatment and some never seek care from the
      formal health care system. It is estimated that 28 percent of the U.S. adult population in any
      year has a diagnosable mental or addictive disorder, and yet less than one-third of these
      individuals seek treatment. Objective: The objective of this study is to estimate the effect
      of health insurance characteristics on mental health and substance use (MH/SA) treatment
      utilization for privately-insured employees and their dependents. Methodology: Using a
      two-part model, I estimate the effect of MH/SA health insurance characteristics on the
      decision to use MH/SA services and, conditional on use, the number of treatment days.
      Probability of use is modeled using a random-effects logit model and the number of treatment
      days is modeled using a random-effects negative binomial model. Data used are private
      insurance enrollment and claims data for 1997-1998 from MEDSTAT's Marketscan® database.
      Results: Individuals are found to respond to expected out-of-pocket expenses for outpatient MH
      care, but this response is very small. Furthermore, MH/SA health characteristics appear to
      have little or no effect on SA treatment utilization for spouses and other dependents. My
      models show that the effect of MH/SA health insurance varies for individuals by their
      relationship to the policy (i.e., primary beneficiary versus spouse or other dependent).
      Primary beneficiaries are found to be more responsive to these characteristics iv than spouses
      and other dependents. When significant, the requirement of precertification by an employee
      assistance program (EAP) has a negative effect on MH/SA utilization. Conclusions: My findings
      suggest that the response to cost-sharing for MH care demand is similar to general medical
      care and brings into question previous arguments against parity for MH/SA treatment. Finally,
      the role of an EAP is not straightforward. Rather than facilitating treatment access, EAP
      precertification may create an obstacle to treatment and discourage utilization. However, it
      is also possible that EAP precertification may decrease formal utilization by providing some
      brief MH/SA services to individuals with milder conditions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The objectives were to (1) determine if article-first-authors (afa) in 8 journals
      published in 1998 and 2002 affiliated with North America (NA), Europe (EU), Oceania (OC= SE
      Asia), or other regions cited references with first authors (rfa) with differing frequencies
      and (2) contrast the influence of journal geographic origin (NA= JDR, JPD, OD, AJD; EU= EJOS,
      DM, CR, JD) on these patterns. Articles (n=653) and references (excluding case reports,
      reviews and non-research items) were classified (using ISI and PubMed databases) by first
      author geographic affiliation. Results for both years (1998, 2002) were identical. Articles
      from NA and EU cited reference-first-authors from their own continent-of-origin more
      frequently (p&lt;0.001). Pooled journals (NA versus EU) showed geographic differences.
      Geographic bias may affect reader impressions of the pertinent literature and distort key
      indexes of citations such as scientific impact factors.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The presence of metabolic syndrome (MS) or frailty aligns an older adult with
      increased risk for health decline. Physical activity is an important part of health
      maintenance in older adults, but optimal doses of physical activity are unclear with these two
      health conditions. This study examined the longitudinal associations between different doses
      and types of physical activity and incidence of MS and frailty. Participants from the Health,
      Aging and Body Composition Study were followed for six years to ascertain long-term MS and
      frailty status. Physical activity doses at baseline included weekly time (low, recommended,
      high), intensity (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous) and type (sedentary, lifestyle active,
      exercise active). In MS as the outcome, in men, dose-response curves generally were linear,
      with increasingly lower doses of time, intensity and activity type resulting in a higher
      incidence of MS. In women, intermediate doses of time and intensity were associated with the
      lowest incidence of MS, indicating a U-shaped dose-response curve. Results also indicated that
      the time and intensity physical activity doses were not associated with frailty; however,
      being exercise active was associated with reduced risk for frailty. In those who had
      progressed to frailty within six years, we found that the sedentary and lifestyle active
      participants were at increased risk for severe frailty compared to the exercise active in a
      dose-response manner. The optimal dose of physical activity for reducing the risk of MS in
      older men is spending, iv on average, more than thirty minutes per day in vigorous activities.
      The optimal dose of physical activity for reducing the risk of MS in older women is meeting
      the current recommendations for time spent in weekly physical activity in activities of light
      intensity such as light housework, shopping, or volunteering. Expending 1000 kcals/week in
      physical activities that are done with the intent of exercising, such as walking for exercise,
      strength training or aerobic dance, can reduce the risk of frailty onset and severity in older
      adults.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The Herbst appliance is an adjunctive treatment for the correction of Class II
      malocclusions. Previous studies have indicated that the correction following the end of
      treatment frequently relapses. The purpose of this study was to assess the cephalometric
      changes during and following a treatment protocol of 12 months of Herbst appliance treatment
      followed by fixed appliance treatment, and 12 months of retention. The changes from the end of
      treatment to the retention recall were, on average, very small. The only statistically
      significant changes (Mixed linear model; P&lt;0.05) observed were relapse in the ANB angle
      (-0.31 degrees;sd=0.88 ), overjet (0.49mm;sd=0.94) and overbite (0.55mm;sd=0.98). These
      changes were considered not clinically significant. The Class II correction effected by this
      treatment protocol appears stable one year out of treatment.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Depression, the most common mental disorder, is the leading cause of years lived with
      disability and responsible for the majority of the more than 800,000 suicides annually. In
      addition, individuals with depression are more likely to have comorbid chronic diseases.
      Determination of dietary factors related to the incidence of late-life depression, presence of
      ischemic brain lesions, and depression outcomes is needed in order to characterize better the
      complex relationship between depression and vascular disease. Vascular nutritional factors
      (dietary attributes believed to either promote or prevent cardiovascular disease) were
      examined in three groups of elderly individuals: vascular depression, non-vascular depression,
      and comparison subjects. These same dietary factors were examined for their relationship to
      brain lesion volume in those with vascular depression. Dietary quality was assessed as a
      predictor of both depression outcome and lesion volume progression. Nutrient intake was
      assessed in elderly depression and comparison subjects using a Block 1998 food frequency
      questionnaire. Brain lesion volumes were calculated from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
      Depression subtype (vascular or non-vascular) was determined by the extent of hyperintensities
      on brain MRI. All subjects received medical comorbidity assessments, and depression subjects
      received psychiatric assessment and treatment. iii Vascular nutritional factors were found to
      differ between depression and comparison subjects but tended to be similar across the two
      depression groups, while most factors were unassociated with brain lesion volume. Depression
      subjects (both groups) consumed more cholesterol, trans-unsaturated fat, and high-fat dairy
      products, had higher body mass index (BMI) values and Keys scores, and consumed less fruit
      than comparison subjects. High-fat dairy and whole grain consumption were significantly and
      positively correlated with brain lesion volume, even after adjustment for age, sex,
      hypertension, diabetes, and total kilocalories. Dietary quality was not associated with
      longitudinal change in depression score or lesion volume. These findings may indicate the
      influence of "vascular" nutrients on late-life depression, regardless of the
      presence of comorbid cerebrovascular disease. The less healthful diets of depression subjects
      may have important implications for management of comorbid chronic diseases that are commonly
      associated with depression.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Close communication between axons and glial cells is required and necessary for
      maturation, organization and maintenance of the nervous system. The axon provides signals to
      promote differentiation, survival and proliferation of both oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells
      in the central and peripheral nervous systems respectively, while providing instructions to
      regulate myelin thickness. Conversely, glial cells provide reciprocal signals that regulate
      and control axonal mechanisms such as axonal thickness and transport. The combined efforts of
      glial and axonal signals result in a mature myelinated fiber that has a structural
      organization optimal for a maximum conduction velocity. One characteristic feature of
      myelinated fibers is their ability to organize specialized domains with distinctive molecular
      and structural characteristics. The myelinated domains include the node of Ranvier, the
      paranodal junction, the juxtaparanodal junction and the internodal region. This domain
      organization is a result of the fine bi-directional communication between the axon and the
      overlying glial cell. The paranodal axo-glial junction is a complex of proteins including:
      NCP1, Contactin (CN), Neurofascin 155 (NF155) and band 4.1B. NF155 is expressed by the
      overlying glial cell while the others are clustered on the axonal membrane. All proteins are
      necessary for the maintenance and establishment of the paranodal domain and provide a link to
      the axonal cytoskeleton. We and others have previously characterized two knockout mice (NCP1
      and CGT) that display several signs of cerebellar deficits, including abnormal motor
      coordination, tremors at rest and ataxia. These knockouts share the same phenotypes one of
      which is their inability to form paranodal junctions properly. Interestingly NCP1 is an axonal
      protein and CGT is a glial protein suggesting a common mechanism of action by both cell types
      and the importance of axo-glial interactions in proper axonal development and organization.
      The goal of this project is to further understand the role, molecular composition and
      organization of axo-glial junctions in vertebrate systems, in particular the paranodal
      junction of myelinated nerve fibers. We will use these two knockout mouse model systems to
      identify new key components that play a role in establishing a link between the axon and glial
      cells.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Age-related declines in cognitive processing are well documented and may contribute to
      limitations performing daily living tasks as people age. The purpose of this dissertation was
      to examine the relationships among cognitive processing, physical function, and disability in
      older adults. Three studies were organized into three distinct manuscripts. In this
      dissertation, we use the term cognitive processing to refer to performance on measures of
      attention and processing speed. The objective of the first study was to examine the direct and
      indirect effects of cognitive processing on physical function and disability. The second study
      examined: (1) the predictive relationship of cognitive processing to changes in physical
      function and disability, and (2) the association of change in cognitive processing to change
      in physical function and disability. The purpose of the third was to explore the relationship
      of cognitive processing to self-reported disability measured as dependence and measured as
      difficulty. The combined results of all three experiments confirmed that cognitive processing
      is associated with both concurrent and future levels of physical function and disability in
      older adults. The relationship between cognitive processing and disability is primarily
      mediated by physical function, such that poor cognitive processing is associated with lower
      levels of physical function and indirectly with higher levels of disability. Poor baseline
      cognitive processing is also predictive of decreased balance and disability one year later.
      The relationship of cognitive processing with disability appears to be most robust when iv
      disability is defined as dependence. These results illustrate the complex relationship of
      cognitive processing to physical function and disability in older adults.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Treatment result and compliance for orthodontic Medicaid patients was assessed and
      compared to non-Medicaid patients of similar initial severity. All 55 practices providing
      orthodontic treatment covered by Medicaid were asked to submit their last five Medicaid cases
      and five non-Medicaid cases of similar initial treatment complexity. Nine practices agreed to
      participate. Initial models, final models, and progress notes were obtained for all subjects.
      Casts were scored using the peer assessment rating (PAR) index to obtain treatment result
      data. Progress notes were reviewed for compliance data. No significant differences were seen
      between the Medicaid and non-Medicaid groups based on initial PAR, final PAR, or the percent
      of PAR reduction. No significant compliance differences were seen based on broken
      appointments, broken appliances, or number of poor oral hygiene comments. The Medicaid and
      non-Medicaid patients in our study did not differ significantly in the effectiveness of
      treatment received or their compliance with treatment.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Repeated administration of the D1-dopamine receptor agonist SKF-38393 to adult rats
      lesioned with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) as neonates results in increasingly greater
      behavioral responsiveness with each dose, a phenomenon known as "priming of D1
      receptor sensitivity." This dissertation examines the role of the extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK), an intracellular mediator of signal transduction, in
      D1-dopamine receptor activation, priming of behavioral sensitivity, and structural plasticity
      in the neonate-lesioned rat. Using immunohistochemistry, I found that repeated administration
      of SKF-38393 produced a prolonged increase in phosphorylated (phospho-) ERK in the medial
      prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of neonate-lesioned rats. A corresponding increase in the
      phosphorylation of CREB (cyclic AMP-response element binding protein), a downstream target of
      ERK signaling, implied a functional consequence for the prolonged ERK activation in mPFC.
      Pretreatment with the D1 antagonist SCH-23390, but not the 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin, prior
      to each dose of SKF-38393 blocked the persistently increased phospho-ERK. The competitive and
      non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists MK-801 and CGS-19755, which inhibit the induction of
      behavioral sensitization in neonate-lesioned rats, also blocked the increased phospho-ERK. In
      addition, intracerebroventricular (ICV) and systemic administration of SL327 or PD98059,
      inhibitors of the upstream ERK activator MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase kinase 1/2), prior to each SKF-38393 treatment eliminated mPFC
      phospho-ERK. Computer-monitored activity chambers and visual observation both revealed that
      the global MEK inhibition increased horizontal behavior and decreased certain stereotyped
      behaviors after an additional sensitizing dose of SKF-38393. In addition, intra-mPFC infusions
      with PD98059 only decreased stereotyped behaviors in primed animals. Finally, using
      immunohistochemistry for MAP2 combined with recombinant adenovirus (AAV) transduction of green
      fluorescent protein (GFP) in mPFC neurons, I found that repeated administration of SKF-38393
      produces robust, long-lasting changes in the morphology of dendrites in mPFC of
      neonate-lesioned rats. Pretreatment with SL327 and PD98059 prevented these changes, suggesting
      that the alterations in dendritic morphology require ERK pathway activation. Collectively,
      these results demonstrate that D1 and NMDA receptors cooperatively produce prolonged ERK
      pathway activation in mPFC of primed neonate-lesioned rats, and suggest that persistent ERK
      phosphorylation in mPFC plays a pivotal role in long-lasting behavioral and structural
      adaptations in these animals.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>A significant number of cancer patients treated with the topoisomerase inhibitor,
      irinotecan, experience severe, delayed-onset diarrhea. Clinicians will typically reduce
      subsequent doses of irinotecan in affected patients, which may result in diminished
      effectiveness of the anti-cancer agent. The active metabolite of irinotecan, 7-ethyl-10-
      hydroxy-camptothecin (SN-38), has been implicated as the colon-toxic agent, by causing direct
      injury to colonic epithelial cells. SN-38 is consequently detoxified to SN-38 glucuronide
      (SN-38G) by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isozymes expressed not only in the liver, but
      also in the gastrointestinal tract. Although luminal SN-38 has been identified as an important
      mediator of diarrhea, the influence of intestinal UGTs at the site of toxicity has not been
      addressed. Thus, intestinal SN-38 glucuronidation was studied to address the hypothesis that
      UGT activity in the intestine is a critical factor in modulating SN-38 toxicity, as enteric
      cells have the ability to prevent SN-38 toxicity locally through UGT expression. The primary
      human and rat isoforms that glucuronidate SN-38 were identified, many of which are localized
      in the intestine. SN-38 carboxylate was found to be a suitable, more soluble surrogate for the
      active lactone form for in vitro glucuronidation, as the rank order of UGT isoform catalysis
      was similar for the two forms, despite different rates of conjugation. Intersubject SN-38
      glucuronidation in human intestinal tissue from duodenal, jejunal, and colonic regions was
      variable, and was highly correlated with both UGT1A1 and 1A9 probe iv substrate
      glucuronidation, indicating a primary role for these isoforms in intestinal SN-38G formation.
      The hypothesis that intestinal UGTs modulate SN-38-induced diarrhea was directly tested in a
      Gunn rat model with reconstituted hepatic UGT activity via adenoviral gene delivery. These
      rats, devoid of intestinal UGT1A activity, were highly susceptible to intestinal damage and
      diarrhea after irinotecan administration, compared to control heterozygote rats, which
      possessed both hepatic and intestinal UGTs. Collectively, this research advanced the knowledge
      of the metabolic detoxification of SN-38 in the intestine by establishment and identification
      of appropriate in vitro reaction conditions, isoform specificity and expression, and
      variability in glucuronidation. These studies have also supported the hypothesis that
      intestinal UGT expression modulates the incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity to SN-38.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease resulting from the
      misregulation of epithelial ion transport. CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an apical membrane chloride channel expressed in
      polarized epithelial cells. To identify factors that regulate CFTR activity, we utilized
      biochemical and proteomics approaches to identify novel CFTR binding proteins. We find that
      the C-terminus of CFTR directly interacts with the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A. PP2A is
      a heterotrimeric phosphatase composed of a catalytic subunit and two divergent regulatory
      subunits (A and B), which mediate the cellular localization and substrate specificity of the
      enzyme. By mass spectrometry, we identified the exact PP2A regulatory subunits associated with
      CFTR as A? and B'?, and find that the B'? subunit binds CFTR directly. PP2A subunits localize
      to the apical surface of airway epithelia and PP2A phosphatase activity co-purifies with CFTR
      in Calu-3 cells. In functional assays, PP2A inhibition blocks the rundown of basal CFTR
      currents and increases channel activity in excised patches of airway epithelia and in intact
      mouse jejunum. Moreover, PP2A inhibition increases the pericilliary liquid in cultures of well
      differentiated human bronchial epithelial iv cells by a CFTR-dependent mechanism. Thus, PP2A
      is a relevant CFTR phosphatase in epithelial tissues and may be a clinically relevant drug
      target for CF. Additionally, the N-terminus of CFTR directly interacts with two actin binding
      proteins, filamin A and filamin B. In polarized epithelial cells, filamins are highly
      localized to the sub-apical compartment where they likely interact with CFTR at or near the
      plasma membrane. We find that CFTR and filamins specifically interact by
      co-immunoprecipitation and that a disease-causing mutation in CFTR, serine 13 to phenylalanine
      (S13F), disrupts this interaction. Consistent with the loss of cytoskeletal anchorage, S13F
      CFTR displays decreased cell surface levels and less confinement at the plasma membrane
      relative to wildtype CFTR. Furthermore, S13F CFTR is more rapidly degraded compared to
      wild-type CFTR which correlates with the accumulation of S13F CFTR in the lysosomes. Taken
      together, these data suggest the filamins regulate the cell surface stability and endocytic
      trafficking of CFTR.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation is an evaluation of the North Carolina Polypharmacy Initiative
      (Initiative). The Initiative was a demonstration project that remunerated nursing home
      consultant pharmacists for value-added drug regimen reviews using a claims-generated patient
      profile that flagged targeted drugs and drug classes for review. Shewhart's PDSA
      (Plan-Do-Study-Act) cycle is used as the framework to guide this evaluation. The Initiative
      brought about three distinct PDSA cycles throughout its history. The first was the pilot
      project, and the second was a statewide endeavor, while the third continues through other
      programs and settings in North Carolina. It is the goal of this dissertation to inform the
      planning stage of future PDSA cycles of pharmacist services in nursing home settings. Three
      formal evaluations of the initiative were conducted. The first evaluation, a before-after
      without comparison group study found a per member per month (PMPM) drug cost savings of $30.33
      due to initiative activities. The second, a before-after with comparison group study found a
      PMPM drug cost savings of $19.04. The third, a beforeafter with propensity matched comparison
      group found a PMPM drug cost savings of $21.36. Flags (alerts) were reduced for two types of
      alert categories across all evaluations and their sub-group evaluations. The first, alerts for
      drugs on the Prescription Advantage List (PAL) iv were substantially reduced with a percentage
      reduction of 19.2% for all persons having a pharmacist review. The PAL list a voluntary
      preferred drug list sponsored by North Carolina Medicaid. The second, alerts for drugs on the
      Clinical Initiatives List were also substantially reduced with a percentage reduction of 9.6%
      for all residents having a pharmacist review. The Clinical Initiatives List was a list of
      drugs submitted by consultant pharmacy organizations that were targeted for cost-effectiveness
      and quality concerns. Overall, Phases 1, 2 and 3 of the Initiative produced consultant
      pharmacist reviews for 19,144 nursing home residents. These reviews generated 17,545
      recommendations that resulted in greater than 10,000 drug changes. Findings from this
      dissertation support the conclusion that a targeted program using pharmacists to review
      patient profiles may be quickly launched and expeditiously conducted across large numbers of
      patients, at least in long-term-care settings.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Spectroscopic analysis was used to study the patterns of changes in the mineral and
      matrix properties of dentin during maturation of the tissue. Fourier Transform Infrared
      Imaging (FTIRI) analyses on undecalcified semi-thin sections from fetal bovine incisors and
      developing mouse molars were performed. In addition, fetal bovine microdissected mantle and
      circumpulpal dentin specimens of successive tissue age were analyzed by Fourier Transform
      Infrared (FTIR) analysis and by amino acid and matrix phosphate assays. In the initial
      studies, the formation of mantle and circumpulpal dentin as two distinct dentin compartments
      in the developing fetal incisors was established through analysis of distribution of
      mineral:matrix and mineral crystallinity values. Changes in the mineral:matrix, mineral
      crystallinity, acidic phosphate substitution and carbonate substitution in the mineral of
      mantle and circumpulpal dentin during maturation were subsequently quantitatively analyzed
      from FTIRI results. In this study, separate patterns of changes in mineral properties were
      found for mantle and circumpulpal dentin, in terms of initial and final levels and rates of
      increase or decrease of mineral properties values. Spectroscopic analysis of different
      maturation stages iii microdissected mantle and circumpulpal dentin specimens showed a great
      decrease in the dentin relative water content, affecting the dentin matrix conformation.
      Chemical analyses of similar microdissected specimens showed a significant increase in the
      organic phosphate of dentin matrix occurring during maturation. This increase was associated
      with continuing phosphorylation of existing phosphoproteins without further changes in the
      protein density. Finally, the study of dentin maturation using 6 day-old mouse molars by FTIRI
      was validated. Reproducibility in the pattern of changes in the mineral properties examined
      was found to be highly dependent on the sectioning orienation of molars. It is likely that
      higher resolution analytical methods and/or slightly older animal age would enhance the
      analytical outcome in such studies.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In the U.S., coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death and disability in
      women over the age of 50. Increasing physical activity is a major component of cardiac
      rehabilitation programs; but physical activity behaviors decline dramatically during the
      months following a cardiac event, especially for women. Little is known about the processes of
      women's adoption of a more physically active lifestyle or the factors involved. Therefore, the
      purpose of this dissertation was to describe and explore, for women participating in a 12 week
      formal, Phase II CR program, intra-individual patterns of change in the processes of recovery,
      specifically in adopting increased levels of physical activity. The first article provides an
      integrative review and critique of the current research examining self-efficacy and physical
      activity behaviors in older women and women with CHD. The literature is characterized by a
      limited number of women in the studies of individuals with CHD, a reliance on self-reports for
      the measurement of behavior, and a limited assessment of the process of health behavior
      change. The second article presents the results from the study of 20 women who were followed
      during their 12 weeks of participation in a program of cardiac rehabilitation. At baseline, 4,
      8, and 12 weeks, the women completed measures of physical activity (pedometer) and a ii i
      variety of psychosocial and behavioral assessments. Findings indicated that most (80%) women's
      physical activity declined during the last month of rehabilitation. Self-efficacy expectations
      for walking and for overcoming barriers to physical activity also declined during the last
      month of rehabilitation. Most women reported being neutral about goal setting activities,
      indicating that goal setting was not an important behavior change strategy. Implications for
      clinical practice and future directions for research are suggested. The third article
      discusses the findings related to social comparisons (comparing one's situation and behaviors
      to others) gathered from a questionnaire and open-ended interviews. Social comparisons did not
      seem to be a major psychosocial factor in adjusting to heart disease or in increasing physical
      activity levels. Rather, women relied on feedback and input from their physicians and from the
      exercise staff for gauging their progress.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The United Health Foundation (UHF) produces an annual State Health Rankings (SHR)
      report, generating substantial media and public attention. The report uses a methodology that
      weights the contributions of several risk factors and outcome measures to produce an overall
      score for each state; the states are then ranked according to their score. The overall purpose
      of the SHR report is to activate public conversation concerning health, to provide information
      to facilitate citizen participation, and to stimulate news stories. While some states have
      adapted the rankings for informing or changing health policies, gaps in awareness of this
      resource, as well as the knowledge of how to use the SHR to improve health still exist. The
      goals of this study were to investigate how the UHF SHR influences state policymakers. The
      study's aims included: (1) evaluating the communication campaign for the UHF SHR; (2)
      identifying activities and short-term outcomes initiated by policymakers or decision-makers
      who have used the UHF SHR to facilitate policy change; (3) examining the significance of the
      SHR as a format for presenting health information. The study used a qualitative evaluation
      approach. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with state-level policymakers who have
      used the SHR to affect policy change in their state. Purposive sampling was used to recruit
      subjects in this study. Study subjects were recruited from among people who contacted UHF
      about using the SHR for policymaking, state Chief Information Officers, and members of the
      Association of Health Care Journalists and the Association of State and Territorial Health
      Officers. UHF publicity materials, dissemination materials, and news reports were reviewed as
      part of the process evaluation. Interviews suggested alternative explanatory frameworks that
      focused on key components or themes in relating policymakers to the SHR, including: data
      entrepreneurs, policy communities, and the symbolic nature of the rankings. The study
      hypothesizes that the consistency of SHR information allows data entrepreneurs to translate
      the overall ranking into a symbol that can be used to engage others in action. The study
      intends to demonstrate that effective data entrepreneurs can transform the overall state
      ranking to specific components to facilitate local action.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Epithelia create barriers and regulate solute and water transport through
      transcellular and paracellular pathways. The paracellular pathways of different tissues vary
      remarkably in size selectivity, ionic charge selectivity and transepithelial electrical
      resistance (TER). The claudin family of transmembrane proteins is responsible for conferring
      these variable properties. In order to better understand the contribution of paracellular
      transport and claudins to the function of an epithelium, the properties conferred by
      cell-specific expression and localization of individual claudins need to be better understood.
      Here, we explore the properties of claudin- 14 and the localization pattern of claudins in the
      liver. Expression of human claudin- 14 significantly increases TER and decreases permeability
      to sodium. Quantitative PCR revealed hepatic expression of 9 of 16 claudins tested at levels
      varying as much as 700-fold. Immunofluorescent localization revealed localization of claudins-
      1, -2 and -3 to hepatocytes, claudin-5 to endothelial cells, and claudins-3, -7 and -8 to
      cholangiocytes.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>From examining reports of the American Revolution in French newspapers, this thesis
      evaluates the French perception of the American military from the beginning of the war until
      the French-American alliance in 1778. During the 1770s, French officers and savants were
      referring to ancient sources to reform the military’s practical problems and flagging
      patriotism. One officer, the Comte de Guibert, proposed the French adopt a “citizen army” as
      the ultimate solution. In this context of reform, the American military appeared to epitomize
      the patriotism and success of the ancient militaries. The hearty support of the American
      military that appeared in a government propaganda paper reveals the significance of the
      American image to the French government and European elite. During these early years of the
      American Revolution, the press coverage constructed an archetypal image of the American army
      and militia that informed French officers and enlightenment writers’ understanding of military
      operations and patriotism.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation proposes and evaluates a new approach for generating realistic
      traffic in networking experiments. The main problem solved by our approach is generating
      closed-loop traffic consistent with the behavior of the entire set of applications in modern
      traffic mixes. Unlike earlier approaches, which described individual applications in terms of
      the specific semantics of each application, we describe the source behavior driving each
      connection in a generic manner using the a-b-t model. This model provides an intuitive but
      detailed way of describing source behavior in terms of connection vectors that capture the
      sizes and ordering of application data units, the quiet times between them, and whether data
      exchange is sequential or concurrent. This is consistent with the view of traffic from TCP,
      which does not concern itself with application semantics. The a-b-t model also satisfies a
      crucial property: given a packet header trace collected from an arbitrary Internet link, we
      can algorithmically infer the source-level behavior driving each connection, and cast it into
      the notation of the model. The result of packet header processing is a collection of a-b-t
      connection vectors, which can then be replayed in software simulators and testbed experiments
      to drive network stacks. Such a replay generates synthetic traffic that fully preserves the
      feedback loop between the TCP endpoints and the state of the network, which is essential in
      experiments where network congestion can occur. By construction, this type of traffic
      generation is fully reproducible, providing a solid foundation for comparative empirical
      studies. Our experimental work demonstrates the high quality of the generated traffic, by
      directly comparing traces from real Internet links and their source-level trace replays for a
      rich set of metrics. Such comparison requires the careful measurement of network parameters
      for each connection, and their reproduction together with the corresponding source behavior.
      Our final contribution consists of two resampling methods for introducing controlled
      variability in network experiments and for generating closed-loop traffic that accurately
      matches a target offered load.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this dissertation, we used high temperature NMR to study the dynamic behavior of
      metallic liquids and glasses from completely molten state to temperatures well below the glass
      transition. We found that there are different processes in the system that have distinct
      effects to NMR probing methods, so we employed several NMR techniques to study these processes
      separately. A dramatic temperature dependence of Knight shift was recorded and it was
      attributed to the fast vibration and rattling processes. A transition was directly observed at
      Tc which is about 100K above the glass transition temperature. The result was shown to be
      consistent with MCT, mode coupling theory. Nuclear quadrupolar relaxation, 1-d lineshape
      analysis and stimulated echo techniques were utilized to study the slow processes. At high
      temperatures, the dynamics follow the MCT predictions. Starting from Tc and below, a
      decoupling in diffusion behavior between the light/small atoms and heavy/big ones was
      discovered. We discussed possible dynamic and thermodynamic explanations. In the second part
      of the dissertation, we used NMR to study the primary crystallization in some Aluminum-based
      metallic glasses. A precursor for crystallization was found even in as-quenched samples. A
      common metastable state was discovered at low temperatures. We also presented some studies on
      the electronic structure and short-range order of some metallic glasses and possible
      correlations of such properties with the glass forming ability.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Medical images of human anatomy can be produced from a wide range of sensor
      technologies and imaging techniques resulting in a diverse array of imaging modalities, such
      as magnetic resonance and computed tomography. The physical properties of the image
      acquisition process for different modalities elicit different tissue structures. Images from
      multiple modalities provide complementary information about underlying anatomical structure.
      Understanding anatomical variability is often important in studying disparate population
      groups and typically requires robust dense image registration. Traditional image registration
      methods involve finding a mapping between two scalar images. Such methods do not exploit the
      complementary information provided by sets of multi-modal images. This dissertation presents a
      Bayesian framework for generating inter-subject large deformation transformations between two
      multi-modal image sets of the brain. The estimated transformations are generated using maximal
      information about the underlying neuroanatomy present in each of the different modalities.
      This modality independent registration framework is achieved by jointly estimating the
      posterior probabilities associated with the multi-modal image sets and the high-dimensional
      registration transformations relating these posteriors. To maximally use the information
      present in all the modalities for registration, Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
      estimated posteriors is minimized. This framework is extended to large deformation multi-class
      posterior atlas estimation. The method generates a representative anatomical template from an
      arbitrary number of topologically similar multi-modal image sets. The generated atlas is the
      class posterior that requires the least amount of deformation energy to be transformed into
      every class posterior (each characterizing a multi-modal image set). This method is
      computationally practical in that computation times grows linearly with the number of image
      sets. The multi-class posterior atlas formation method is applied to a database of multi-modal
      images from ninety-five adult brains as part of a healthy aging study to produce 4D
      spatiotemporal atlases for the female and male subpopulations. The stability of the atlases is
      evaluated based on the entropy of their class posteriors. Global volumetric trends and local
      volumetric change are evaluated. This multi-modal framework has potential applications in many
      natural multi-modal imaging environments.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study examines how states and counties communicate disaster information to
      Hispanics. Through 13 interviews with state emergency management communicators and a national
      survey of 435 county emergency management directors, the study benchmarks how many channels
      states and counties employ to communicate Spanish-language disaster information. The study
      addresses who state emergency management communicators and county emergency management
      directors believe should be responsible for developing and providing Spanish-language disaster
      information. Also, the study explores county emergency management directors' perceptions of
      how capable various nongovernmental and governmental groups are of producing Spanish-language
      disaster information. Finally, the study explores whether principal-agent theory helps explain
      the variety of channels states and counties employ to communicate Spanish-language disaster
      information. The interviews revealed that most of the state emergency management communicators
      do not provide Spanish-language disaster information. Communicators that do provide
      Spanishlanguage disaster information do so mostly through working with groups (e.g., Catholic
      Church, American Red Cross, and local government officials) to develop this information. The
      interviews also revealed that communicators think counties primarily are responsible for
      developing and providing Spanish-language disaster information. iv The survey found that most
      of the counties communicate Spanish-language disaster information through at least one
      channel, but counties communicate English-language disaster information through three times
      more channels. Also, contrary to what state communicators believe, county emergency management
      directors believe the federal emergency management agency (FEMA) and states primarily are
      responsible for developing and providing Spanish-language disaster information. County
      directors also believe FEMA and the states are most capable of developing Spanish-language
      disaster information. These findings provide evidence that goal conflict (one of the key
      constructs of principal-agent theory) exists between the states and counties. Also, the survey
      found that one of the most important factors that affects the variety of channels county
      emergency management directors employ to communicate Spanish-language disaster information is
      how often the directors work with groups such as FEMA, state emergency management agencies,
      and nongovernmental groups. Like state communicators, county directors work with a diverse set
      of groups. Thus, no single group emerges as a leader in producing and providing
      Spanish-language disaster information. Also, there is no clear channel through which states
      and counties communicate about how best to produce and provide Spanish-language disaster
      information, providing evidence of information asymmetry (the other key construct of
      principal-agent theory).</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized three categories of regulations on expression:
      content neutral, content based, and viewpoint based. Whether a regulation will be upheld
      depends in large measure on the Court's determination of the category to which it belongs. The
      Court has devised tests to review content-neutral and content-based regulations, but it has
      said that viewpoint-based regulations are unconstitutional. The categorical approach thus
      seems to depend on a clear demarcation between the content and viewpoint concepts. This
      dissertation explores how the Court has distinguished between content and viewpoint
      discrimination and concludes that the distinction, despite its importance, remains unclear.
      The Court has failed to adequately define the terms and the criteria to be used in determining
      whether content or viewpoint discrimination is present. In identifying content discrimination
      involving private speech and speech in public forums, the dissertation shows that the Court
      has waffled among three approaches, variably relying on the face of the regulation, the
      purpose of the regulation, and the effect of the regulation. The Court has further clouded its
      jurisprudence when reviewing restrictions on private speech and speech in public forums by
      conflating the content and viewpoint terms. In limited public forum, nonpublic forum, and
      subsidy cases, the Court has ruled that content discrimination is permissible. Viewpoint
      discrimination, however, remains unconstitutional. In spite of the Court's stated prohibition
      of viewpoint discrimination, the dissertation shows that the Court has applied the concept
      differently depending on the speech context. In addition, this dissertation examines whether
      the Court's lack of definitions and inconsistent applications permit ideological manipulation
      of the concepts. Using data from The Supreme Court Compendium that categorize the ideological
      voting behavior of justices on the Court, the dissertation studies decisions in three socially
      divisive areas of law in which content and viewpoint discrimination have been central issues
      of significant cases. With a few notable exceptions, the lineups of justices in the cases
      largely mirror the justices' ideological voting behaviors. The dissertation concludes by
      proposing a new method of analysis for courts to follow that has clearer guidelines and leaves
      less room for ideological biases to influence case outcome.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The federal government's use of new data technologies, specifically knowledge
      discovery in databases (KDD) applications, in counterterrorism efforts presents a serious
      challenge to existing constitutional privacy protections. The purpose of this dissertation is
      to explore whether this use of KDD technology infringes upon a constitutional right to
      information privacy. A broad discussion of how the constitutional right to privacy in general
      and information privacy in particular has been conceptualized by the courts is presented.
      Following a review of privacy scholarship, traditional legal case analysis is used to identify
      privacy conceptualizations in three types of privacy cases: U.S. Supreme Court First Amendment
      anonymous speech and association cases, Fourth Amendment privacy cases, and those Supreme
      Court and U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal cases involving information privacy claims. Five
      conceptualizations of privacy are discussed. Three were found in the privacy scholarship:
      privacy as space, privacy as secrecy, and privacy as information control. The analysis of U.S.
      Supreme Court and U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal information privacy cases reveals a newly
      emerging conceptualization of privacy, privacy as confidentiality. Under this
      conceptualization, individuals are empowered to compel government to safeguard the personal
      information it has forced them to surrender and to hold state actors responsible for knowing
      which constitutional information privacy interests are clearly established. This is a
      significant departure from the first three conceptualizations because the responsibility for
      protecting personal information resides with the government rather than the individuals to
      whom the information belongs. The most significant finding presented in this dissertation is
      that none of these four conceptualizations are sufficient to protect privacy against KDD
      dataveillance. Since these applications create new knowledge rather than access and manipulate
      existing information, a new conceptualization, privacy as knowledge control, is needed. Should
      the courts adopt and vigorously apply a privacy-as-knowledge-control conceptualization of
      privacy, individuals will have the right to be informed that new information regarding them
      has been created, that the government has information safeguards in place to protect this new
      knowledge, and that they have the right to challenge the government on constitutional grounds
      regarding the use of the discovered knowledge.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>A person's worldview might moderate the way a persuasive message is processed,
      sometimes in the opposite direction of that intended by communicators. This dissertation
      explored the possibility that a worldview can influence the way a persuasive message is
      perceived. Building on the construct of worldview, the heuristic-systematic model of
      persuasion, and terror management theory, this dissertation examined the question in a
      betweenparticipants post-test only 2 (expertise cue) X 2 (argument quality) X 2 (mortality
      salience) X a relativist worldview (a measured variable) experiment (N = 149). Some
      participants in the experiment were reminded of their eventual death, while others were asked
      to think of watching television. Then, participants' tendency toward a relativist or
      traditional worldview was assessed. Participants viewed mock ads that featured either strong
      or weak arguments and had either an expertise cue or no cue at all, after which they rated the
      ads in terms of their attitudes toward the ad (Aad), the attitudes toward the brand (Abrand),
      and behavioral intentions. Worldview had a main effect on global evaluations of the ads, such
      that participants who tended toward a relativist worldview had lower evaluation of the ads and
      lower behavioral intentions. Mortality salience was found to moderate participants' worldview,
      presumably making their worldview more accessible in evaluating the ads. This dissertation
      also found separate main effects for worldview and argument quality on attitude toward the ad
      and attitude toward the brand, respectively. The implications for the heuristic-systematic
      model and terror management theory are discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>At least since Robert Dahl's (1957) pathbreaking essay, Decision-Making in a
      Democracy: The Supreme Court as a National Policy-Maker," political scientists have
      invested tremendous energy in exploring linkages between the Supreme Court and its
      environment. This dissertation joins those efforts by offering studies of three such paths of
      influence °owing from the judiciary. In turn, I investigate the effects of Supreme Court
      decisions on public opinion, the role of judicial review in legislative decision-making, and
      the responsiveness of the media's agenda to Supreme Court decision-making. In all cases, the
      evidence suggests that the Supreme Court's influence extends beyond the legal world and into
      the larger political system.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>What is the collective action necessary to overcome educational inequality? And was
      educational inequality overcome through legalized school desegregation? These are the
      questions that drive the following study. This study looks closely at the community impact
      from a specific school desegregation case decided in 1986 in Northern California. Through a
      court order, local school districts were directed to allow a small portion of African American
      and white students to transfer voluntarily to neighboring school districts outside of their
      assigned boundaries in order to create racial balance, thereby improving educational
      achievement for African American students. The program, known as the Tinsley Voluntary
      Transfer program is in existence today. Here, the researcher begins unpacking the meaning of
      school desegregation and its impact in a local context. This study grounded in critical race
      theory also suggests a need to reassess outcomes and conclusions from 52 years of legalized
      school desegregation cases. The gap in educational achievement between African Americans and
      whites participating in the voluntary transfer program and African Americans and whites not
      participating in the voluntary transfer program persists at virtually the same statistical
      average in both settings. While results from the study do indicate individual African American
      students who participate in the program show improvement over African American students who do
      not participate in the program, there is overwhelming evidence that no marked improvement in
      the collective educational achievement of African American students visà- vis white students
      came as a result of the Tinsley case.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The current research was conducted in order to test the effects of contextual
      information on the social categorization process and to examine the nature of the Black
      stereotype. Two studies sought to accomplish these goals by using a modified flanker paradigm
      in which participants categorized targets as Black or White while context information,
      determined by emotion words (Experiment 1) or stereotype-related words (Experiment 2), was
      simultaneously presented. Additionally, participants in each study completed a
      well-established test of racial bias (weapons task; Payne, 2001) to try to ascertain possible
      connections between the categorization of racial cues amid distracting context information and
      automatic and controlled components of racial bias. Behavioral and physiological results
      indicated that White participants did not process contextual information until later stages of
      processing and attended first to Black targets and then to White targets. Finally, although
      not fully supported, there was some preliminary evidence that a stereotype involving fear may
      be more connected to the Black social category than are other negative stereotypes.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation deals with contemporary women writing in Spanish America, Brazil,
      and the Caribbean. I explore how identity is constructed in Clarice Lispector's Perto do
      coração selvagem [Near to the Wild Heart], A paixão segundo G.H. [The Passion According to
      G.H.], Água viva [The Stream of Life], and A hora da estrela [The Hour of the Star]; Isabel
      Allende's Eva Luna, Hija de la fortuna [Daughter of Fortune], Retrato en sepia [Portrait in
      Sepia], and La casa de los espíritus [The House of the Spirits]; Michelle Cliff's Abeng, No
      Telephone to Heaven, and Free Enterprise. In these texts the characters have difficulty
      accepting their compulsory gender roles, which are for the most part attributable to a
      hierarchical, male-dominated society and perpetuated by almost everyone. I argue that this
      process of gender identity formation is both particular (individual, formed by the inner
      strength of each character) and collective (shaped by society's demands). Since gender
      identity formation is an open-ended process, none of the characters can be said to have
      clearly defined their genders or to have definitively shaped their identities. Other issues,
      such as class and race, also play an important role in shaping identity and are dealt with in
      my analysis. The role of history is questioned in the works of Isabel Allende and Michelle
      Cliff, who attempt to bring new perspectives to historical facts. My theoretical approach
      synthesizes various analyses by scholars such as Judith Butler, Benedito Nunes, Hélène Cixous,
      Nancy Chodorow, and Stuart Hall. Chapter I discusses some complexities regarding the
      definition of gender as well as gender relations in Latin America and the necessity of mutual
      support among genders. Chapter II reads Clarice Lispector's novels, paying particular
      attention to the journey within that composes the characters' search for identity. The third
      chapter argues that Isabel Allende's texts encompass a search for the self with rewritings of
      history from a woman's point of view. Chapter IV examines Michelle Cliff's novels, which
      present strong awakenings concerning racial as well as gender identity and the struggle for
      power in the relation between colonized and colonizer.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The focus of this thesis is the identification and structural characterization of iso-
      lated biomolecules in superfluid helium nanodroplets. We have recently developed structural
      tools for studying isolated biomolecules, including nucleic acid bases (NABs) (cytosine,
      guanine, uracil, thymine, and adenine), their mono-hydrated complexes and other biologically
      important molecules, using high resolution infrared laser spectroscopy. The structural tool
      called vibrational transition moment angle (VTMA) has been developed for measuring the angle
      between the permanent dipole moment and transition dipole directions in these species and
      provides unambiguous structural determinations for many systems. This is a very powerful
      technique, especially for larger systems, be- cause relatively low level ab initio
      calculations are able to predict the correct VTMA, when the calculated and experimental
      vibrational frequencies do not agree. Another powerful tool for structural determination is
      used to determine the dipole moments of various isomers by measuring the intensity of a
      particular band as a function of direct current electric field. We have applied these new
      techniques to the study of the isolated biomolecules, such as tautomerism of NABs, their
      nonplanarities, energetics, and the intermolecular interactions in the hydrated NABs. These
      results provide benchmarks for the evaluation of ab initio calculations being carried out on
      these systems.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>I begin this dissertation by employing the themes of mapping, meeting, and migration
      to explore nineteenth century encounters between the Latter-day Saints and Asia. There were a
      number of interpersonal meetings between both American religious groups and East Asians. As
      missionaries, travelers, and residents of the American West, the Mormons were able to interact
      with and evaluate a number of Chinese and Japanese at home and abroad. Migration illuminates
      how the Mormons and Protestants interacted with East Asian immigrants in America. In chapter
      two, I document that by the turn of the twentieth century LDS Church leaders determined to
      shift some of their church's evangelistic resources from North America and Western Europe to
      the nations of East Asia, South America, and Eastern Europe. But they did not feel the need to
      adapt their missionary program to non-Christian, non-Western peoples. The Japan Mission, which
      lasted from 1901 until 1924, overlapped the heyday of the American Protestant foreign
      missionary enterprise. But the Mormons and Protestants employed different evangelistic
      approaches. The Mormons had developed a unique method of evangelism in the Protestant North
      American and Western European historical context, which I call the "Euro-American
      missionary model." In chapter three I argued that the Mormons felt like strangers in
      a strange land in Japan. They were uncertain how to missionize the Japanese who came from such
      different cultural and religious backgrounds. Unlike the Protestants who stressed education
      and social welfare efforts, the Latter-day Saints emphasized personal contacting and the
      dissemination of Christian literature. When the Mormons tried to modify their traditional
      evangelistic practices they ended up mostly entertaining the Japanese. After nearly two and a
      half decades of sluggish missionary results in Japan, president Heber J. Grant determined to
      close his church's only Asian mission. I argue that the LDS wholesale transplant of the
      Euro-American missionary model to Japan was largely responsible for the mission's dismal
      results and closure. The homogeneity of the missionaries' personal backgrounds, lack of
      missionary preparation, and costly financial burdens, together with the church's relative
      neglect of the Japan Mission's need for human resources, compounded these problems.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this dissertation, I examine three aspects of organizational emergence: composition
      of founders' support networks, acquisition of external organizational knowledge, and a
      multidimensional approach to identifying emergent organizations. I draw on organizational,
      social capital, human capital, and social exchange theories to develop my hypotheses. Based on
      a random sample of nascent entrepreneurs in the United States, I found that founders rely
      heavily on their strong ties to solicit support; use their specific human capital to guide
      their acquisition of external knowledge; and follow unique founding processes that differ
      across industrial groups.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Carbon nanotubes have received much attention in recent years due to their high
      structural stability and interesting electronic and transport properties. These novel
      properties can be utilized in many areas of applications. Many of these applications require
      modifications to pristine nanotubes. In particular, chemical functionalizations have been
      shown to be an attractive method to tailor some of electronic and mechanical properties. In
      this study, I present our computational study on electronic and transport properties of
      covalently side-wall functionalized carbon nanotubes. We found that functional-groupinduced
      impurity states play important roles in modifying electronic and transport properties of
      nanotube near the Fermi level. A drastic difference has been found between monovalent and
      divalent functionalization cases. In monovalent functionalizations, the impurity states are
      located near the Fermi level and have strong effects on both electronic and transport
      properties. On the other hand, divalent functionalizations do not cause any significant
      disruption near the Fermi level due to rehybridization of two adjacent impurity states into
      bonding and antibonding states located relatively far away from the Fermi level. We believe
      that the covalent functionalization induced property changes provide a pathway for the band
      structure engineering, electronic, and chemical sensor applications of carbon nanotubes</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper empirically investigates the role of stock price informativeness in the
      real sector using a sample of corporate spinoffs from 1975 to 2001. In the first part, I
      examine the impact of stock price informativeness on a firm's managerial decisions and
      operating performance. I find that changes in informativeness around the spinoff are
      positively related to the subsequent changes in operating performance of the parent firms.
      Those firms with increased informativeness make significant adjustments to improve investment
      efficiency following the spinoff. The results suggest that managerial investment decisions
      serve as one of the channels through which informed trading in the market contributes to firm
      performance. In the second part, I examine the changes in CEO compensation structure around
      the spinoff and investigate how it relates to stock price informativeness and operating
      performance. I find that firms increase the proportion of stock-based compensation
      significantly following spinoffs. These changes in stock-based compensation are positively
      associated with changes in subsequent firm performance, suggesting that stock-based
      compensation is an effective tool in structuring managerial incentives. I also find that
      informativeness-performance association stays positive and significant, controlling for the
      change in compensation structure around the spinoff. In sum, my findings provide support for
      the view that informed trading matters to the real sector.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>According to the accessibility-diagnosticity framework, momentarily more accessible
      aspects of a product can have a disproportionate influence over the evaluation of the product
      by blocking other aspects of the product that are less accessible, yet perhaps more
      diagnostic. In the three essays of my dissertation, I investigate how to use different types
      of mental simulation to enhance the accessibility of the naturally ignored information to
      overcome related negative consequences. In essay 1, I combine research on choice over time and
      process vs. outcome-focused mental simulation. Choice over time research indicates that
      high-level desirability considerations are more accessible for the distant future and
      low-level feasibility considerations are more accessible for the near future, leading to
      preference inconsistency over time. I propose that preference consistency could be achieved
      through: 1) outcome simulation (which is focused on the desirability consideration of an
      event) for the near future, or 2) process simulation (which is focused on the feasibility
      consideration of an event) for the distant future, due to the complementary role of each type
      of mental simulation at each point in time. In addition, I propose that time is a key factor
      that could potentially explain the conflicting findings in the mental simulation literature
      regarding the effectiveness of process vs. outcome simulation. In essay 2, I investigate the
      domain of new products and find that while high-level desirability considerations appear more
      accessible than low-level feasibility considerations for incrementally new products (INPs),
      really new product (RNPs) are represented with both the desirability and feasibility
      considerations. As such, the traditional process and outcome simulation do not differ in terms
      of their impact on product evaluations for RNPs. However, when examining the specific
      information processing modes with a cognitive or affective focus, I find that outcome
      simulation is more effective at increasing the evaluation of RNPs than process simulation
      under a cognitive mode, whereas the reversal is true under an affective mode. Further, the
      degree of planning and level of uncertainty and are found to partially mediate this
      interactive effect. In essay 3, I switch to a different dimension of consumers' mental
      representations when evaluating new products: memory vs. imagination-focused representations.
      I demonstrate that people naturally rely on the more readily accessible images from their past
      memories while neglecting imaginative new activities. I propose and test the effect of the
      imaginative-focused visualization strategy which enhances the naturally neglected imaginative
      new uses of the RNPs and leads to higher evaluation for RNPs. In addition, essay 3 indicates
      that ease of imagination directly impacts product evaluation for RNPs such that higher ease
      leads to higher evaluations. In all three studies of essay 3, focus of visualization and ease
      of visualization have a limited role on the evaluation of INPs.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Research on polymerizations catalyzed by late metal complexes has been rejuvenated
      since our lab reported cationic 9-diimine Ni/Pd catalysts which are active to polymerize
      ethylene into high molecular weight polymers with unique branched microstructures. Compared
      with early metals, the reduced oxophilicity of late metals has also enabled these catalysts to
      copolymerize ethylene with polar olefins. Neutral coordinated bidentate Ni(II) catalysts are
      expected to exhibit enhanced polar group tolerance compared with their cationic counterparts,
      due to the weakened metal-oxygen bond. New neutral (N,O)Ni(II) catalysts, each of which has a
      bulky N-aryl group have been reported and studied for ethylene homoand copolymerization.
      Chapter 2 describes the synthesis, characterization and polymerization studies of new neutral
      anilinoenone-based (N,O)Ni(II) catalysts having a strong electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl
      group. These catalysts are active for ethylene polymerization to form branched polymer in the
      presence of an activator. Changes in the substitution pattern affect the catalytic activities
      and polymer properties. Polymerization results are compared and discussed. Chapter 3 presents
      mechanistic investigations of ethylene insertion and coordination with neutral anilinoenone
      (N,O)Ni(II) catalysts. An ethylene insertion barrier is derived by bulk ethylene
      polymerizations at various pressures at 60 °C. Preliminary results of copolymerization of
      ethylene with polar and nonpolar olefins indicate a reduced catalytic activity compared to
      ethylene homopolymerization. Chapter 4 details a study to enhance the catalytic activity of
      anilinotropone (N,O)Ni(II) catalysts by adding strong electron-withdrawing nitro groups to the
      ligand backbone. These modified catalysts display dramatically enhanced activity for ethylene
      polymerization. The results are compared with the unnitrated parent catalysts.
      Copolymerization of ethylene and polar or nonpolar olefins and oligomerization of 9-olefins
      using these catalysts are also performed and presented.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>MX chain interactions lead to formation of anisotropic materials with possible
      optical, semiconducting, and device miniaturization applications. These interactions are
      explored in a variety of PtII/PtIV systems. Platinum N-R-salicylaldimine complexes, Pt(sal-
      R)2, are candidates for formation of MX chain materials based on their structural and
      electronic properties, as determined by density functionl theory (DFT) calculations. The trans
      geometry of Pt(sal-n-Bu)2Cl2, determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD), is
      compatible with MX chain formation. Electrochemical analysis of M(sal-R)2 complexes results in
      electro-oxidative polymerization. The mechanism for polymerization is discussed. Pt(sal-R)2 (R
      = n-Bu, n-Dec, Ph) complexes are determined to oxidize at less positive potentials than
      Ni(sal-Ph)2 (0.66, 0.65, 0.61, and 0.59 V, respectively). DFT calculations of Pt(sal-Me)2 and
      Ni(sal-Me)2 determine a dpi* and pi*(ligand) HOMO composition consistent with the observed
      oxidation potentials. Platinum dialkyl-2,2'-bipyridine-4,4'-dicarboxylates (Ln, n = number of
      carbon atoms in the alkyl chain) are analyzed for their potential to form liquid crystalline
      MX chain interactions. Crystal structures of PtL1Cl2, PtL2Cl2, and PtL16Cl2 are presented. The
      new PtLnCl4 complexes (n = 10, 12, 16, 20) display smectic mesophases (30-194 degree C
      overall). Mesophase ordering is believed to occur through pi-pi interactions of adjacent
      bipyridine moieties. Re(CO)3LnBr and CdLnCl2 complexes (n = 12, 18) were prepared to study the
      tolerance of the mesophase to different metal geometries. Through optical microscopic and
      differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses, Re(CO)3L18Br is determined to be mesogenic,
      while the Cd complexes are not. The PtL16Cl2/PtL16Cl4 molecular alloy forms a ColH mesophase.
      This is the first binary liquid crystalline system to include a PtIV component. DSC analyses
      of the enthalpy change associated with mesophase formation and XRD analyses suggest a 1:1
      PtL16Cl2/PtL16Cl4 alloy consistent with formation of the first MX interactions in a liquid
      crystalline phase. Solid-state PtL16Cl2 and PtL16Cl4 complexes were characterized by
      luminescence spectroscopy, and both complexes demonstrates evidence of a CT lowest energy
      excited state consistent with DFT calculations of PtL1Cl2 and PtL1Cl4 orbitial energies. The
      longer-lived emission from mixtures of PtL16Cl2 and PtL16Cl4 is enhanced in intensity compared
      to emission from the individual species. Samples that have selfassembled into the
      PtL16Cl2/PtL16Cl4 alloy do not luminesce.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Transition metal reactions that involve C-H and N-H bond activation provide a
      potential method for functionalizing hydrocarbons and amines. For the past three decades there
      have been numerous advances in this field; however, developing new approaches to activation of
      these bonds continues to be a significant endeavor. Recently pincer ligands have been
      successfully used to stabilize metal complexes at elevated temperatures. When chelated to
      iridium, these pincer complexes have been shown to be very active as transfer dehydrogenation
      catalysts. This has been exemplified by Kaska, Goldman, and Jensen using Ir complexes
      containing the 2,6-(CH2PtBu2)2C6H3 (PCP) ligand and by Brookhart using the Ir complexes of the
      more electron-deficient bis(phosphinite) pincer ligand (POCOP). This dissertation explores
      alternative reactivity of these bis(phosphinite)iridium complexes. Chapter 2 focuses on the
      reactions of [(POCOP)Ir] with N-H bonds, in particular those of both anilines and benzamides.
      The electronic character of the anilines plays an important role in the reactivity; more
      electron-withdrawing anilines favor oxidative addition while the more electron-donating
      anilines favor ?-bond formation. An explanation for this behavior is provided along with a
      kinetic analysis of the oxidative addition and reductive elimination of anilines. A comparison
      of the reactivity of anilines to that of benzamides is also discussed. In Chapter 3, cationic
      [(POCOP)Ir(H)(L)][BArF] complexes are examined that contain
      tetrakis(trifluoromethylphenyl)borate (BArF) as a non-coordinating counterion. Since these
      complexes are cationic, the metal center is even more electron deficient than those mentioned
      above. The structure of [(POCOP)Ir(H)(H2)][BArF] was determined based on an H-D coupling
      constant of 33 Hz. In addition to the structural analysis, the rate of exchange between the
      hydride and the dihydrogen has also been determined. Cationic olefin complexes,
      [(POCOP)Ir(H)(L)][BArF] (L = C2H4, C3H6, norbornene, methyl acrylate) have also been
      synthesized. Their dynamic behavior has been assessed using both line-broadening and
      spin-saturation transfer NMR techniques. The rates of olefin rotation and insertion into the
      Ir-H bond were analyzed and energy barriers to these processes were calculated. A brief
      examination of the reactivity of the cationic norbornene complex with nucleophiles has also
      been explored; however the results showed no C-Nuc bond formation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Beyond the Walled City examines the course of urban expansion in Havana to 1909. It
      begins with the modernization efforts that led to a critical event in the city's history:
      demolition of the city walls that had, until then, marked its western edge. While expansion to
      the west appears to be a logical step in accommodating the growing number of inhabitants
      within the city, urban growth was also influenced by a growing colonial concern with the urban
      subcultures of Havana. The presence of criollos, free urban people of color, and an increasing
      number of urban poor in and around the city, all questioned habaneros' ideas of modernity and
      evoked a fear of barbarity long into the first decades of the twentieth century. My
      dissertation argues that among the many factors that shaped urban growth in Havana was a
      long-standing fear of these newly urban habaneros, whose presence forced the demographic and
      physical layout of the city. During the administration of Captain-General Miguel Tacón
      (1834-1838), urban planning became a central concern of the city government, as evidenced by
      the infrastructural developments that gave Havana its present-day design. As the city expanded
      outside of the walls (las murallas) to accommodate a growing middle class, paradigms of power
      similarly shifted to reflect urban changes. The result was a reconceptualization of how the
      modern city would be defined, by whom, and who would be allowed access into its perimeter. In
      this light, urban expansion emerges as a centuries-long attempt to reconcile urban tensions
      between social and political classes. The purpose was to arrest the development of those urban
      subcultures that called into question the image of the city-and by extension the nation-as
      modern and urban(e). The century-long concern of city officials with the urban inhabitants
      reveals that Havana remained a city in which the battle for modernization was waged daily in
      the developing spaces of the metropolis. Beyond the Walled City chronicles this process of
      urbanization, seeking as well to document the role of habaneros and of memory in the modern
      design of Havana. </mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation examines the rebellions of marginalized female characters in six
      works by Georg Hermann and Arthur Schnitzler. In doing so, it brings works to the fore that
      have been underestimated by literary criticism; the two Schnitzler plays were overshadowed by
      his later work, and Hermann's body of work was never seriously reappropriated by scholarship
      after the Second World War. This dissertation also contributes to scholarship on the period,
      because it examine4s these works as cultural products. Taking as my premise George Mosse's
      assertion that artistic production is indicative of its age, I read these works as evidence of
      social discourses on gender and power around 1900, thereby adding to the evidence examined in
      socio-historical texts. In the introduction, I discuss the social framework in which the
      literature is to be read, giving an overview of the authors' lives and backgrounds. I then
      explain the relevance of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic work, indicating why his case study of
      Dora can be read alongside fiction. In each of my three chapters, one work by Schnitzler is
      compared with one by Hermann. First, the social setting in which the female characters find
      themselves is established. Socio-historical scholarship is then drawn upon, in order to delve
      more deeply into the role that these characters play. In the first chapter, the physical
      categories of the prostitute, the femme fatale and the corpse are discussed through the works
      of Françoise Barret-Ducroqc, Carola Hilmes, and Elisabeth Bronfen. In the second, the
      intellectual categories of the actress and the New Woman are informed by studies by Deborah
      Gorham, Tracy Davis, and Ann Heilmann. In the third, Gayle Rubin's discussion of the traffic
      in women is linked to the discourse on hysteria, as found in the works of Freud, Bronfen, and
      others. Having thus set the stage, each chapter then investigates the female characters'
      rebellion from these categories, into which they are expected to fit, be it through suicide,
      withdrawal from society, or hysteria. In conclusion, I argue that while Schnitzler's works
      have been amply studied, much more is yet to be written on Hermann's wealth of literature</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation focuses on the works of the Italian writer Ida Baccini, specifically
      on her important pedagogical contribution towards the formation of a new Italian nation after
      1861. It also explores the educational and ideological agenda that the writer sought to
      inculcate in Italian adolescents and children of the 19th century. The study of Ida Baccini is
      divided into three chapters. The first chapter looks at the ideological and stylistic
      innovations that the writer produces in her novels for children. The second chapter explores
      the evolution of the writer's ideas regarding the image and the role of young women in Italian
      society. The third chapter analyzes Ida Baccini's scholastic literary production and her model
      of a primary school teacher. Having thoroughly considered Ida Baccini's criticism towards
      traditional family, school organization, and children's literature, the conclusion
      demonstrates how Ida Baccini proved to be a decisive figure in Italian pedagogy, beginning a
      new chapter in children's literature that shifted its focus onto the child's perspective and
      his or her needs.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Relationships among racial socialization, racial identity, perceived discrimination,
      and achievement were examined in 126 African American youth and their parents. A subsample of
      parents (n = 8) also completed qualitative interviews which were used to expand upon the
      quantitative findings. Perceived racial discrimination was positively related to preparation
      for discrimination socialization. Racial identity was positively related to academic
      achievement. Data obtained from the qualitative interviews prompted an investigation of
      preparation for discrimination as a function of adolescents' self-reliance. Results showed
      that self-reliance was positively related to preparation for discrimination socialization. The
      results illustrate factors that precipitate racial socialization and achievement in African
      American youth. Implications for future research and educational policy are discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Chapter One briefly introduces the basics of redox molten salts and
      monolayer-protected Au nanoparticles. Chapter Two examines the mass transport of counterions
      in molten salts of ruthenium complexes where the counterions are mixtures of perchlorate and
      iodide ions. The average diffusion coefficients of the counterions were obtained by ionic
      conductivity impedance measurements, while that of iodide (as a surrogate for perchlorate ion
      transport) was measured directly using iodide voltammetry. Agreement between the
      conductivity-based and Faradaic counter ion transport data provides a quantitative validation
      of previous use of ionic conductivity data in electron transfer dynamics study in redox
      semi-solids. Chapter Three focuses on the ligand-exchange reaction of phenylethanethiolate
      (SC2Ph) ligands on 1.1 nm Au nanoparticles with varied amounts of triphenylphosphine. The
      results from UV-Vis, NMR and electrochemistry suggest that the reaction liberate AuISC2Ph
      complexes (accompanying core size change), as opposed to SC2Ph thiols, the common out-coming
      ligands in thiolat-to-thiolate ligand exchange reaction on Au nanoparticles. Chapter Four
      explores a room-temperature Au38 nanoparticle polyether melt in which voltammetric and
      chronoamperometric, and impedance measurements have been made, respectively, of the rates of
      electron and ion transport in the melt. The measured rates of electron and of electrolyte ion
      transport are very similar, as are their thermal activation energy barriers, observations that
      are consistent with a recently introduced ionic atmosphere relaxation model for control of
      electron transfer in redox polyethers. Chapter Five describes ferrocenated imidazolium molten
      phases where ferrocene is chemically linked to various dialkylimidazoliums. The physical
      properties, including density, fluidity, and ionic characteristics, are discussed. The
      electrochemical results are presented in Chapter Six. It is observed that the electron
      diffusion in structurally-different ferrocenated imidazoliums is more efficient than the
      physical transport of redox ions. The rate of electron transfer is linearly correlated to the
      counterion diffusion, the first observation from imidazolium-based redox semi-solids
      consistent with the counterion relaxation control of electron transfer model. Chapter Seven
      investigates the surface properties of Au nanoparticle films contacted with imidazlium ionic
      liquids. A dynamic contact angle change is observed and explained on the basis of anion
      penetration which is further compared to the formally similar electrowetting phenomenon.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis presents the development and analysis of stochastic and deterministic
      models of cellular biochemical networks, such as signaling pathways and gene regulatory
      networks. First, the model of the yeast pheromone response pathway is constructed. Stochastic
      modeling reveals that the biochemical steps that regulate activation of the mitogen-activated
      protein kinase Fus3 can account for the graded-to-binary conversion. The model is also used to
      investigate the effects of protein turnover on the response of the pathway. It is demonstrated
      that the inclusion of protein turnover can lead too sustained oscillations of protein
      concentration in the absence of feedback regulation, which indicates protein turnover as a
      important signaling regulation mechanism. Second, an engineered promoter that allowed the
      simultaneous repression and activation of gene expression in Escherichia coli was constructed
      and used to construct a stochastic model to study synthetic gene networks under increasingly
      complex conditions: unregulated, repressed, activated and simultaneously repressed and
      activated, and in the presence of positive feedback. The stochastic model quantitatively
      captures the means and distributions of the expression from the engineered promoter of this
      modular system and accurately predict the in vivo behavior of an expanded network that
      includes positive feedback. The model also reveals the counterintuitive prediction that noise
      in protein expression levels can increase upon arrest of cell division, which was confirmed
      experimentally.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The dissertation analyzes the impacts of an individual's unobserved ability on
      schooling and wages in the context of a developing country using rich data from the Cebu
      (Philippines) Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey. Unlike any previous study, my model
      allows for grade repetition and school reentry after dropping out of school. Both phenomena
      are common in developing countries in general, and in the Philippines in particular.
      Semiparametric approach is used to control for an individual's unobserved ability. The results
      indicate that children with lower innate ability enter school at a later age and complete
      fewer years of school. They are also more likely to drop out of school at all levels of
      education, but the effect of lower ability diminishes at higher levels of education. A
      standard Mincer-type regression appears to be misspecified. Results strongly suggest presence
      of heterogeneity in the returns to education by an individual's ability. Rates of return to
      education appear to be nonlinear differing across three educational levels.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Carbon nanotubes possess many excellent field emission properties. An obstacle to
      these applications is that there is no simple and reproducible method to prepare a single
      carbon nanotube field emitter. In this dissertation, individual carbon nanotube field emitters
      have been fabricated in a two-step process involving (a) producing micron-size carbon fibers
      which contain single carbon nanotubes at their cores and (b) exposing the nanotubes by
      fracturing the fiber with mechanical forces and mounting the fiber to a copper ribbon with a
      groove. This fabrication method has the potential to be the production method for single
      carbon nanotube field emission point electron sources. The cold field emission properties of
      single carbon nanotubes have been studied. These carbon nanotubes exhibit large field
      enhancement factors of 1.1×107 m-1 and low turn-on fields of 1.1 V/?m. An empirical model has
      been developed to calculate the field enhancement factor of an open end nanotube attached on a
      carbon fiber. The lifetime measurements show that a single carbon nanotube can continuously
      emit electrons over 100 hours without significant current drops. The emission stability
      measurements show that the maximum current drift is 3.6%. It is also shown experimentally that
      a carbon nanotube has a high reduced brightness 2.9×108 ASr-1m-2V-1, which is two orders of
      magnitude higher than those of the thermionic electron sources. The thermal field emission
      properties of a single carbon nanotube have been systemically studied. It is found that there
      is a gap between the intermediate region and the field emission region which is not covered by
      either the Fowler-Nordheim theory or the Murphy-Good theory. We have developed an analytical
      equation that describes the thermal field emission behavior of a single carbon nanotube within
      the gap. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical predictions. We also studied
      the effect of Cs doping on the field emission properties and electronic properties of a single
      nanotube. We found that the work function of the carbon nanotube was reduced from 4.8 eV to
      3.7 eV by Cs doping.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Person-environment (P-E) fit research considers the match between individual
      characteristics and environmental characteristics (e.g., jobs, organizations, vocations). Most
      P-E fit research considers person and environment at a moment in time. However, this
      contemporaneous view overlooks the potential impact of an individual's past and future. We can
      more meaningfully portray the relationship between P-E fit and outcomes if we consider
      experiences from the past, present, and future. The inclusion of these three time frames
      produces a "moving window of fit" that can be developed by incorporating
      research on the temporal nature of the person, the environment, and well-being. In addition,
      to determine how these elements of a temporal fit model are related, I consider research on
      the processes of contrast and assimilation. To conduct an initial test of the temporal P-E fit
      model, I consider a needs-supplies fit framework that focuses on four job dimensions:
      autonomy, creativity, pay, and work relationships. Using a sample of 187 working MBA students,
      I found that P-E fit relationships become more complex when using a temporal context. Namely,
      how individuals view fit at past jobs and future jobs conditions the effects of current fit.
      In addition, the impact of several of these relationships depends upon several moderators:
      temporal focus, temporal distance, and importance. As a result of these findings regarding the
      moving window of fit, I discuss implications for practice and for future research.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Using external actuating magnetic fields to manipulate magnetic parts is an efficient
      method to manipulate mesoscopic actable devices. Extensive researches have explored the
      potentials of self-assembly techniques based on capillary force, static charge force, drying,
      surface tension, and even dynamic fields as a low cost method for ordered 2D or 3D
      superlattice structures for new materials and devices. But the ability of tunable patterning
      nanoparticles for designed actable devices is still a requirement yet to be met. Utilizing
      anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes as templates, soft-magnetic nanowires around 200 nm in
      diameter, 10 microns long have been fabricated. In this thesis, I describe a method to
      assemble these magnetic nanowires into a two dimension Wigner structure, of which the
      wire-wire distance is conveniently adjustable during the fabrication procedure. Using
      geometric tailored magnetic fields, we can plant these self-assembled magnetic nanowires with
      desired patterns into a thin soft polymer support layer. The final devices may be readily
      actuated by an external actuating magnetic field (a self-designed magnetic system,
      3-dimensional force microscope (3DFM)) with precise patterns and frequencies in a
      micro-fluidic system. This method offers a general method to fabricate mesoscopic devices from
      a wide range of materials with magnetic dipoles to desired structures. And the actable devices
      themselves can find direct usage in low Re number flow mixing and bio-physical fluidic dynamic
      researches. The beating of cilia and flagella, slender cylinders 250 nanometers in diameter
      with lengths from 7 to 50 microns, is responsible for many important biological functions such
      as organism feeding, propulsion, for bacterial clearance in the lungs and for the right-left
      asymmetry in vertebrates. The hydrodynamics produced by these beating structures, including
      mixing, shear and extensional flows, is not understood. We developed an experimental model
      system for cilia beating through the use of magnetic nanowires. We apply our custom magnetic
      system, 3DFM, to drive these magnetic nanowires rotating with desired patterns and frequencies
      in a liquid chamber. High speed movies of passive tracers in the oscillating 3-D flow fields
      reveal the spatio-temporal structure of the induced fluid motion. Complementing these
      experimental studies, we have developed a family of exact solutions of the Stoke's equations
      for a spheroid sweeping a double cone in free space, and an asymptotic solution for a spinning
      slender rod sweeping an upright cone above a flat, infinite no-slip plane. We are using these
      solutions to develop a mathematical package to quantitatively model, and predict the tracer
      motion induced by the spinning nano-rods with and without Brownian noise. To understand the
      effect of these epicyclical flows on molecular conformations, we have studied the conformation
      of fluorescently labeled, single DNA molecules (_-DNA) in the flow produced by a precessing
      nanowire. The flow patterns in a viscoelastic medium about a precessing nanowire are also
      presented to reveal the epicyclical flows in a more biorelated environment.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>ESSAY ONE: Exchange Rate Dynamics and Order Flow: An Alternative Model Realizing and
      overcoming the disadvantages of the well-known model by Evans and Lyons (2002), this essay
      presents an alternative model to connect the exchange rate dynamics and foreign exchange
      market order flow from the perspective of the dealer's quoting behavior in a more realistic
      environment. Agreeing with previous works, the essay shows theoretically and empirically that
      order flow has significant positive effects on the short-run exchange rate change. ESSAY TWO:
      Market Structure and Dealer's Quoting Behavior in the Foreign Exchange Market Realizing that
      the structure of inter-dealer and customer foreign exchange markets is different in terms of
      market transparency and information asymmetry, this essay examines how the differences affect
      the same dealer's quotes in the two markets. It is shown that customer spreads are generally
      wider than inter-dealer ones, while their differential tends to fall with the rise in order
      size. Meanwhile, the same dealer's mid-quotes are found to be equal to each other in the two
      markets. In contrast to the preceding models claiming that the order size has a positive
      effect on the spread, the impact is found to be ambiguous in our study. Supportive empirical
      evidence can be provided by the new data set applied in the essay. ESSAY THREE: The Term
      Structure of the Forward Premium Puzzle In contrast to many previous studies that examined the
      efficiency of the forward market in one particular horizon, this essay tests the unbiased
      hypothesis by using forward rates in the same period but with various maturities. The
      hypothesis continues to be rejected as before in the horizon of 1-week and 1-month, but is
      found to be accepted in the 1-day horizon. It is also found that the magnitude of the slope
      coefficient increases as the horizon rises. A model in the spirit of the term structure model
      of interest rates is proposed to reconcile the inconsistency, and the results of empirical
      testing support the model.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>We have undertaken a comprehensive spectroscopic survey of the Horologium-Reticulum
      supercluster (HRS) of galaxies. With a concentration on the intercluster regions, our goal is
      to resolve the "cosmic web" of filaments, voids, and sheets within the HRS
      and to examine the interrelationship between them. What are the constituents of the HRS? What
      can be understood about the formation of such a behemoth from these current constituents? More
      locally, are there small-scale imprints of the larger, surrounding environment, and can we
      relate the two with any confidence? What is the relationship between the HRS and the other
      superclusters in the nearby universe? These are the questions driving our inquiry. To answer
      them, we have obtained over 2500 galaxy redshifts in the direction of the intercluster regions
      in the HRS. Specifically, we have developed a sample of galaxies with a limiting brightness of
      betaJ &lt; 17.5, which samples the galaxy luminosity function down to one magnitude below
      M? at the mean redshift of the HRS, z is approximately equal to 0.06. Exclusively, these
      intercluster redshifts were obtained with the six-degree field (6dF), multi-fiber spectrograph
      at the Anglo-Australian Observatory. In conjunction with the wide-field, 1.2m UK Schmidt, 6dF
      is the ideal supercluster observatory. Because it deploys the 150 fiber buttons over a
      6-degree field, we are able to obtain coherent information over large areas of the sky, as is
      the case with a supercluster. In addition, we have obtained a complete sample of mean cluster
      redshifts and velocity dispersions for Abell clusters in the HRS using the Australian National
      Uni- versity/2.3m, primarily. For most of the clusters, more than 10 galaxies were observed,
      and a reliable mean cluster redshift is determined. Furthermore, we have a near com- plete
      sample of bJ &lt; 18.6 galaxies over a 4 degree × 4 degree region that encompasses several
      HRS clusters. With these datasets, we are able to "piece" together various
      structures over a large range of scales. We have also obtained high-resolution radio imaging
      over much of this smaller area. We find six void structures in the region with 10 less than or
      equal to RVOID less than or equal to 15 h-1 Mpc that are completely absent of 6dF galaxies
      (except for one void that contains a single galaxy down to our observational limits). To
      discover the voids, we implement the GyVe software tool that provides a 3-D, interactive
      visualization environment. Furthermore, four of these voids are embedded within the
      supercluster environment, while the other two are located at the observed boundaries of the
      HRS. This is reflected in the intrinsically different galaxy number counts profiles as a
      function of radius. The voids maintain their distinct profiles despite the fact that the 6dF
      sample is augmented with thousands of previously published redshifts. We also observe that
      matter (galaxies and clusters) is not distributed evenly around these voids, but seems to
      follow a highly ordered arrangement. Lastly, the intercluster regions (5-10 h-1 Mpc) within
      one of the most dense HRS volumes are examined. We define three different intercluster
      extensions varying in over- density from 20-60, which is 7-10 times the adjacent control
      volumes. Furthermore, we calculate a velocity dispersion of approximately 350 kms-1 within one
      intercluster filament approximately 11 h-1 Mpc in projected length. While varying in projected
      spatial width, the extended collec- tion of intercluster galaxies joins the two richest
      complexes in the region. These galaxies also exhibit a preferred orientation of 60-90 degrees
      along its length. We further note that while some preferred orientations are found within
      smaller substructures, e.g., galaxy groups, these characterizations do not match the
      larger-scale galaxy distributions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Chapter One is an introduction to fundamental properties of Monolayer- Protected Gold
      Clusters (Gold MPCs) including their synthesis, composition and structure, electrochemistry,
      ligand exchange mechanism and optical properties. Chapter Two investigates medium effects
      (supporting electrolyte concentration, type and solvents) on the quantized double layer (QDL)
      charging capacitance of hexanethiolate coated gold cluster Au140(SC6)53. The dependence of
      delta V ( e/CMPC ) on the concentration of supporting electrolyte (from 1 to 100 mM), measured
      using square wave voltammetry, is shown to be caused, primarily, by changes in the diffuse
      double layer component (CDIFFUSE) of CMPC. A numerical simulation was used to calculate
      CDIFFUSE successfully. Additionally, significant changes in the magnitude of the compact
      double-layer component (CCOMPACT ) of CMPC were induced by adding hydrophobic solvent
      components such as hexane or dodecane or by introducing hydrophobic electrolyte ions
      (tetrabutyl-, tetrahexyl-, and tetraoctylammonium, perchlorate and tetra-phenylborate).
      Chapter Three describes the effects of supporting electrolyte concentration, temperature and
      solvent environment on the capacitance of molecule-like phenylethanethiolate coated gold
      clusters Au38(SC2Ph)24 at +1 core charge state with square iv wave voltammetry (SWV),
      differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The effects are interpreted with both the classical
      double layer theory treating the two continuous oxidation peaks as quantized double layer
      (QDL) charging peaks of a monolayer protected gold cluster (MPC) and the concept of
      "molecular capacitance" treating them as a succession of oxidization peaks
      of a molecule. Chapter Four compares the kinetics of exchanges of phenylethanethiolate ligands
      (PhC2S-) on the monolayer-protected clusters (MPCs) Au38(SC2Ph)24 and Au140(SC2Ph)53 with
      rho-substituted arylthiols (rho-X-PhSH), where X = NO2, Br, CH3, OCH3, and OH at 293 K. It was
      found that second-order rate constants for ligand exchange on Au38(SC2Ph)24 are very close to
      those of similar exchange reactions on the larger nanoparticle Au140(SC2Ph)53 MPCs indicating
      vertex site reactivity of these two nanoparticles are ca. the same. However, their ligand
      exchange extent is different. The reverse exchange reaction was also studied for
      Au38(rho-X-arylthiolate)24 MPCs (X = NO2, Br, and CH3), where the in-coming ligand is
      phenylethanethiol. Chapter Five investigates a molecule-like substituent effect on redox
      formal potentials in the nanoparticle series Au38(SPhX)24. Electron-withdrawing
      "X" substituents energetically favor reduction and disfavor oxidation, and
      give formal potentials that correlate with Hammett substituent constants. The ligand monolayer
      of the nanoparticles is shown thereby to play a strong role in determining electronic energies
      of the nanoparticle core, and is more than simply a protecting or capping layer. The
      substituent effect does not, however, detectably change the homo-lumo gap energy. Chapter Six
      investigates the ligand dependent optical properties of Au38(SC2Ph)24 upon ligand exchange
      with different in-coming thiols in THF. It was found that the v luminescence of Au38(SC2Ph)24
      was enhanced more when more polar thiolate ligands were exchanged. What is more, the
      luminescence is linearly correlated with the number of incoming ligands exchanged onto the
      gold core indicating possible existence of localized chemical states of the gold core. Solvent
      effects on the second order rate constants of ligand exchange reaction were also observed.
      Chapter Seven describes the synthesis and characterization of ligand exchange product of
      Au55(PPh3)12Cl6 with pentafluorobenzenethiol. The exchange product was characterized by
      electrochemistry, TGA, TEM, HPLC, UV- vis, Fluorescence, 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation consists of three research topics regarding High Dimension, Low
      Sample Size (HDLSS) data analysis. The first topic is a study of the sample covariance matrix
      of a data set with extremely large dimensionality, but with relatively small sample size.
      Especially the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the sample covariance
      matrix is the focus of our study. Assuming that the true population covariance matrix of the
      data is not too far from identity matrix (i.e., spherical in the Gaussian case), we show that
      the sample eigenvalues and eigenvectors tend to behave as if the true structure of the data is
      indeed from identity covariance. Based on this, the asymptotic geometric representation of
      HDLSS data is extended to a wide range of underlying distributions. The representation
      essentially states that data vectors form a regular simplex in the data space with the number
      of vertices equal to the sample size. The second part of the dissertation studies a
      discriminant direction vector, which is only interesting in HDLSS settings. This direction is
      characterized by the property that it projects all the data vectors, which are generated from
      two classes, to two distinct values, one for each class. It will be seen that this Maximal
      Data Piling (MDP) direction lies within the hyperplane generated by all the data vectors,
      while it is orthogonal to the hyperplanes generated by each class. It has the largest distance
      between piling sites among all the possible piling direction vectors and also maximizes the
      amount of piling. The formula of MDP is equivalent to the Fisher's linear discrimination when
      the dimension is less than the sample size. As a classification method, MDP is heuristically
      desirable when the data are well approximated by the HDLSS geometric representation. The third
      topic relates to kernel methods in statistical learning, especially the kernel based
      classification problem. Taking the case of the Gaussian kernel function for the support vector
      machines and mean difference methods, we propose a novel approach to select the bandwidth
      parameter in kernel functions. The derivation is based on the fact that the bandwidth
      parameter in a kernel function determines the geometry of the high dimensional kernel embedded
      feature space. Compared with cross-validation and other tuning criteria from the literature,
      our approach is demonstrated to be robust to the sampling variation, while maintaining
      comparable classification power and low computing cost, in real and simulated data examples.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Contradictions regarding social relations currently exist within the literature,
      specifically with respect to the nature, causes, and correlates of social position. These
      contradictions stem from conceptual and methodological inconsistencies as well as
      developmental differences in certain traits and constructs. Building from these diverse
      research frameworks, the current study is designed to clarify relationships among relevant
      constructs in order to facilitate future research and the development of practical
      interventions. The current study addressed the contradictions in the literature by
      investigating the relationship between several aspects of social functioning including social
      position (social preference and social prominence) and peer affiliations across the transition
      from elementary to middle school. Peer interpersonal ratings in both fifth and sixth grades
      were available for 566 students; teacher ratings were also collected for those with consent
      for participation (399 students in fifth grade; 417 students in sixth grade). Results
      highlighted the complex nature of social relationships during early middle school when social
      networks are fluid. First, the social position constructs of social preference and social
      prominence were found to diverge for boys across the transition, but to stay constant for
      girls. Next, aggression was found to be negatively correlated with social preference and
      positively correlated with social prominence, with some decrease in the strength and
      significance of these correlations across the transition to middle school, especially for
      social prominence. Gender effects were apparent and suggested that girls' use of aggression at
      the beginning of middle school is complex; these results are considered in the context of
      ethnographic research. Finally, the social position constructs were found to be minimally
      related to the characteristics of peer affiliates, with the most consistent relationships
      between individual social prominence and peer popularity. This study supports the development
      and importance of social interventions at the beginning of middle school when social
      hierarchies are developing and social structures are fluid. Furthermore, it highlights the
      difficulties involved in conducting a static assessment of a dynamic social network.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation challenges the notion that domestic novels by women deal first and
      foremost with sentimentality and feminine virtues. I claim, on the contrary, that women
      writers around 1800 used literature to articulate a variety of political agendas concerned
      with the shifting position of women in society. Writing at a moment that witnessed the
      emergence of distinct public and private spheres and a burgeoning legal discourse about such
      distinctions, women novelists used their fiction to enter directly into the legal debates of
      their era. The dissertation reads narrative fiction by women alongside contemporary legal
      debates, considering how this literature intervenes in public discussions on infanticide,
      domestic violence and divorce. My study concentrates on twenty-two prose works published
      between 1771 and 1829 and written by the following authors: Julie Berger, Marianne Ehrmann,
      Caroline Auguste Fischer, Henriette Frölich, Therese Huber, Sophie von La Roche, Dorothea
      Margarethe Liebeskind, Sophie Mereau, Benedikte Naubert, Dorothea Schlegel, Johanna
      Schopenhauer, Helen Friederike Unger and Wilhelmine Karoline von Wobeser. The introductory
      chapter addresses the shifting boundaries between the public and the private realm. As
      historians have noted, the development of the private-public dichotomy in this era tended to
      exclude women from public life and confine them to the home. Women novelists, I argue, used
      their fiction to create an alternative understanding of the public sphere where women's
      concerns could be expressed and discussed. The remaining chapters offer case studies of how
      women's literature intervened in contemporary legal debates, focusing on infanticide (chapter
      2), domestic violence (chapter 3), and divorce and spinsterhood respectively (chapter 4). My
      analysis organizes these discussions by subject rather than by author. This makes it possible
      to explore the wide range of women authors engaged in using literature to articulate
      socio-political agendas. In this way, I unearth not simply "progressive
      voices" but a broader model of agency.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Biological intercellular communication necessitates rapid and efficient processes.
      Cells must be able to relay and receive messages rapidly and this is accomplished readily
      through exocytosis. Chemical messengers are packaged into membrane-bound organelles known as
      vesicles or granules, which fuse with the outer plasma membrane upon an increase in
      intracellular [Ca2+] caused by influx from the extracellular space or from intracellular
      stores. Ca2+ increases can be effected through membrane depolarization or through receptor
      activation. The chemical messengers are then extruded into the extracellular space where they
      can bind to target cells and initiate a response. Because of the timescale of vesicular
      release and Ca2+ influx, it is necessary to utilize detection techniques that have sufficient
      temporal resolution. Additionally, the minute amounts that are secreted from these vesicles,
      whose dimensions are characteristically at the nanometer level, require a technique that
      possesses sensitivity sufficient to detect them. The electrochemical technique, constant
      potential amperometry, used in conjunction with carbon-fiber microelectrodes, offers excellent
      temporal and spatial resolution as well as sensitivity for electroactive chemical messengers.
      Moreover, the use of a fluorescent dye, fura-2 allows study of the Ca2+ dynamics occurring
      during exocytosis. Both amperometry and fluorescence measurements via fura-2 allow for the
      characterization of exocytosis in bovine and murine chromaffin cells. Amperometry has been
      advantageous in studies involving chromaffin cells. Using this technique, an autoreceptor
      effect that causes facilitation in bovine chromaffin cells was revealed. Since this
      autoreceptor effect appears to occur on very rapid timescales, the exquisite temporal
      resolution of amperometry has permitted the observation and manipulation of this effect with
      minimal perturbation of the cells under study. In experiments involving genetically altered
      mice, amperometry revealed aspects of the exocytotic process that may be affected by specific
      proteins. In studies conducted on R6/2 mice that serve as models for Huntington's Disease, it
      was noted that vesicular quanta was significantly diminished. Also, in other experiments
      conducted in mice that lack the intracellular phosphoprotein, synapsin, vesicular release
      frequency was significantly enhanced. The studies mentioned demonstrate that amperometry with
      carbon-fiber microelectrodes is a powerful tool in studying exocytotic processes.</mods:abstract>

      Cycloaddition Pathways of the Derived Ylides The formation of azomethine ylides from

      described. Efficient carbon-carbon bond cleavage of aziridines through treatment with
      stoichiometric or catalytic amounts of Zn(II) salts has been shown to occur under relatively
      mild conditions. Depending on the constitution of the dipolarophile, the resulting azomethine

               <mods:abstract>Postbellum African American fiction provides an index to the complex attitudes toward
      social status and class divisions that arose within post-Civil War black communities. As I
      argue, African American narratives in the last quarter of the nineteenth century encode the
      discourse of class in discussions of respectability, labor, and discrimination. Conceiving of
      class as a concept that does not necessarily denote economic conditions, both well-known and
      largely ignored narratives of the period emphasize moral and ideological parameters for
      judging social distinctions. Writers theorize whether intraracial class stratification thwarts
      black sociopolitical advancement, fracturing black communities from within, or conversely,
      fosters racial uplift led by the black "better class." Though the fiction
      variably delineates social classes, each of the texts under study in Our Kind of People
      imagines classification as an inevitable and useful means of reforming the turn-of-the-century
      American social order. Subverting the class disparity spurred by Gilded Age materialism,
      Frances E. W. Harper's novels Trial and Triumph (1888-89) and Iola Leroy (1892) examine
      conventional social designations and supplant them with a morally-inflected language of class.
      The works of Katherine Tillman, Sutton Griggs and Paul Laurence Dunbar elucidate the
      problematic relation between labor and status, given black people's proscribed access to
      diverse occupations. Stories from Charles W. Chesnutt's The Wife of His Youth (1899) explore
      the concept of "class-passing," interrogating status as a social performance
      that antagonizes competing factions within African American communities. In The Marrow of
      Tradition (1901), however, Chesnutt highlights intraracial class divisions to foreground the
      similarities between middle-class whites and blacks, thereby challenging Jim Crow segregation
      by promoting class-based social relations. The study concludes by examining the concept of
      "The Talented Tenth" (1903), W. E. B. Du Bois's articulation of the social
      and political saliency of intraracial stratification. "The Talented Tenth"
      aptly encapsulates the predominant class ideology reflected in post-Reconstruction African
      American literature. By underscoring class as an analytical category central to historicized
      readings, Our Kind of People complicates critical approaches that heretofore have analyzed
      postbellum African American literature primarily in terms of race, gender, and religion.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In the wake of the prominent accounting scandals of the past several years, investors
      and standard setters are demanding increased corporate transparency. Nowhere is the demand for
      transparency more salient than with off-balance-sheet financing, of which lease accounting
      plays a major role. At the end of 2004, total rental commitments by U.S. firms from
      offbalance- sheet operating leases exceeded $1 trillion. As standard setters reconsider leases
      as part of their broad reexamination of off-balance-sheet financing, they do so without the
      benefit of empirical research documenting whether capital market participants find the current
      leasing standard value relevant. This paper examines whether as-if capitalized operating lease
      liabilities and capital lease liabilities are both relevant and sufficiently reliable to be
      priced and explores whether equity investors value operating and capital leases differently.
      The results are consistent with the market viewing both operating and capital leases as
      economic liabilities of the firm. However, the results also indicate that capital market
      participants price operating and capital lease liabilities differently, consistent with the
      bright-line tests of the current leasing standard identifying economic differences in
      operating and capital leases. Thus, continuing to require lease disclosures by different lease
      classifications would assure that equity investors will not suffer from a loss of value
      relevant information in the pricing of leases.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>While female authors have been writing about "women's issues" for
      centuries, their foregrounding of women's bodies is a relatively new phenomenon. This
      "literature of the body" is perceived as a way for women to claim back what
      is and has always been theirs. Gioconda Belli's literature of the body presents a mosaic of
      images of woman, through which she empowers women to claim back their body and to celebrate it
      as the site of the multiple facets of woman. After a brief introductory chapter presenting my
      topic, I move to Chapter 2, which explores how Belli embodies "woman" in her
      poetry. In order to contextualize her representation, I first look at several poems by Rubén
      Darío as examples of idealized canonical portrayals. I also analyze poems written by a number
      of women authors who preceded Belli, thereby demonstrating a distinct progression in the
      treatment of women-centered literature. Belli's representation of the erotic woman is the
      focus of Chapter 3, though I also examine some poems by another Central American woman poet
      that illustrate the boldness of her work, particularly because this author was the first
      Central American woman writer to celebrate women's eroticism. These poems also serve as a tool
      by which to investigate the similarities and differences they present with Belli's poetry. In
      Chapter 4 I explore how Belli embodies motherhood. This was a primary topic of her first
      collection of poetry, and one which is a significant element in each of her works to some
      degree. In the final chapter I examine the multiple ways in which Belli embodies another
      subject dear to her heart--Nicaragua--her homeland. As with the other topics that form the
      basis of my analysis, the nation is a subject Belli approaches from many perspectives. Most
      importantly, Belli's exploration of each of these issues displays a discernible evolution, an
      evolution that adds a true depth to her work, one which I endeavor to bring to light in this
      dissertation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper examines the capital structure puzzle that many firms appear to be
      underlevered from a tax savings perspective. More specifically, this paper explores the
      capital structure implications of sponsoring corporate pension plans and finds that firms are
      significantly less underlevered once off balance sheet pension obligations are accounted for.
      I treat corporate pension plans as fully owned subsidiaries and I find that sponsoring
      companies are 35% more levered on consolidated accounts. I calculate marginal tax rates by
      explicitly taking into account the effect of pension contributions on taxable income and I
      find that the tax benefits of debt are 47% larger once pension debt is accounted for. I also
      estimate that the underleverage gap closes by 31% due to pension deductions. Additionally, I
      provide evidence that sponsoring companies use less debt on average than do comparable,
      nonsponsoring companies.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Terrestrial vegetation plays an important role in the exchanges of carbon, water, and
      energy at the land surface. Changes in vegetation productivity at regional or larger scales
      have important implications for regulating the atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate and
      affecting food production. The characterization of large-scale increases in vegetation
      productivity will lead to a better understanding of the distribution and dynamics of carbon
      sources/sinks and climate change. In this dissertation, I examined the increases in vegetation
      productivity at multiple scales. First, I examined the increases in vegetation productivity
      and their associations with climate variability at the global scale over the period 1982 to
      1998 using satellite data and ground-based climatology data. Temperature, and, in particular
      spring warming, was the primary climatic factor associated with greening in the northern high
      latitudes, Western Europe, U.S. Pacific Northwest, tropical and subtropical Africa, and
      eastern China. Precipitation was a strong correlate of greening in fragmented regions only.
      Globally, greening trends are a function of both climatic and non-climatic factors, such as
      forest regrowth, CO2 enrichment, woody plant proliferation, and trends in agricultural
      practices. Second, I analyzed the responses of vegetation productivity to climate both within
      and across biomes for the conterminous US using satellite data and climate data. Forested and
      non-forested biomes differed sharply in their response to spatial gradients in temperature and
      precipitation. Precipitation affected the productivity of all biomes, and the influence of
      precipitation on productivity differed across biomes. The effect of seasonal Tmax and Tmin was
      only apparent for forested biomes, which are less likely to be water limited. The seasonality
      of temperature relations, and the relatively greater importance of Tmin for some biomes,
      suggest that the dominant effect of temperature is through its influence on growingseason
      length. Third, I looked at the rates of western juniper expansion and the resulting C uptake
      in central Oregon over the period 1975-2000 using satellite data, forest inventory data, and
      field measurements. Western juniper expanded at the rate of 0.15% per year over the 25-year
      period. The results suggest that the expansion of western juniper caused C accumulation of
      0.27 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in aboveground woody biomass. Total C stock in aboveground woody biomass
      increased from 0.13 Tg in 1975 to 0.21 Tg in 2000. Western juniper expansion may have a
      significant impact on the regional C budget.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Free radicals play an important role in many important atmospheric and combustion
      reactions. Their study however, is often hampered due to their high reactivity, and thus short
      lifetimes, limiting the number densities which can be generated in the laboratory. While a
      great deal of progess has been made by studying radicals isolated in the gas-phase, much less
      is known about the interactions between radicals, or the interaction between a radical and
      another closed shell species. Clearly of interest is what happens at the transition state of a
      chemical reaction, the point at which bonds are broken and reformed. The areas of the
      potential energy surface that lead up to the transition state are the entrance and exit
      channel valleys, which represent weakly bound clusters between two (or more) reagent or
      product molecules in a chemical reaction. Due to the fact that at long-range the interaction
      potential is almost always attractive, minima develop near the base of the transition state
      which may support bound or quasi-bound states. Given that the barriers to a chemical reaction
      are typically several orders of magnitude larger than the dispersion forces holding these
      entrance channel complexes together, their importance to reaction dynamics has largely been
      neglected. However, there is now compelling evidence that these weak forces may actually
      control the dynamics in some instances due to the corresponding orientational effects. The
      work detailed in this thesis is focused on applying super_uid helium droplets to the study of
      these entrance and exit channel complexes. The extremely cold and gentle nature of the helium
      matrix allows us to stabilize highly reactive complexes and using high-resolution infrared
      spectroscopy we are able to probe the structure and dynamics of these systems.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The dissertation consists of two essays. In "Choosing the Order of Sale in
      Multi-Unit Auctions" I examine a sequence of two English Auctions of two
      common-value, heterogeneous objects: a low-value and a high-value object. I ask the question:
      Should the auctioneer sell the low-value or the high-value first in order to maximize his
      revenue? Under the assumption that bidders' signals about the common-value are affiliated
      random variables, I study two models. In Model I, some bidders only want to buy the high-value
      item while the others only want the low-value item. In Model II, there are also some bidders
      that want both objects. In Model I, I show that: (1) It is optimal for the seller to auction
      the low-value item first, when the number of bidders competing for the high-value object is
      not greater than the number of bidders competing for the low-value object. (2) When there are
      more bidders in the auction of the high-value item than in the auction of the low-value item,
      then either order of sale can be optimal for the seller, depending on the relative values of
      the objects. In particular, if there are sufficiently more bidders competing for the
      high-value object, then it is optimal for the seller to auction the high-value item first. I
      also show that the main insights from Model I generalize to Model II. In the second essay,
      "Voluntary Disclosure to Form a Research Joint Venture" I investigate why
      many potentially successful research joint ventures (RJV) do not start and suggest a way to
      remedy the problem. To inform potential partners about the value of the know-how that it would
      bring into an RJV, a firm must disclose some of this know-how. In a weak intellectual property
      rights environment, this creates the danger of exposing the firm to expropriation: The
      revealed know-how cannot be protected and the potential partners may use it to innovate
      themselves. Because of this fear of expropriation, many potentially successful RJVs cannot be
      formed. I introduce a contractual procedure that guarantees that firms disclose their know-how
      fully and encourages firms to form RJVs.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The North Carolina Standard Course of Study can be conceptualized as a grid of
      objectives and expectations within which the daily work of public school teachers takes place.
      Overlaying this grid on the high school literature curriculum is much like overlaying a grid
      on a topographical map: the grid defines both itself and the spaces between its lines. But the
      map is never the territory. Part of a teacher's work is navigating the interstices of the grid
      - figuring out what really exists on the actual ground between the lines and deciding how best
      to traverse that terrain with her students as it becomes visible. This study explores the
      energies that reading activates in students' and teachers' private selves and the relationship
      between those private experiences and the public ones they have when they "talk about
      the reading" in their classrooms. It also explores the choices literature teachers
      make when they teach reading. What is the role of high school literature teachers'
      "off the grid" lives in their "on the grid" practice of
      reading books with students? The study's principal data are conversations with three English
      teachers from three public high schools in North Carolina. The diverse literatures of
      psychoanalysis, social theory, reader response theory, performance theory, and teacher
      autobiography are explored as hermeneutic lenses. The concept of jouissance helps explicate
      both the role of pleasure in the classroom and its unique relationship with text. The tension
      between "complicated" and "complex" understandings of
      language, the liminal and performative aspects of pedagogical choices, and the relationships
      of teachers to their institutional authority (here posited as "complicity")
      are also explored. The educative opportunities that exist in these "potential
      spaces" are revealed to have profound implications for preservice and inservice
      teacher education as well as larger policy issues.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Chapter 1 provides empirical evidence of the effect of stock options and total
      compensation on the job turnover of corporate Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). Our estimates
      indicate that both the amount and the composition of the compensation package are significant
      determinants of turnover probability. Holding the total amount of compensation constant, an
      increase in the proportion of stock options in the total compensation from its median level
      (0.48) to the 75th percentile level (0.67), would result in a decrease in annual turnover
      probability from 16 percent to 13.5 percent. On the other hand, holding the proportion of
      stock options constant, if the total compensation increases from the median level ($2.5
      million) to the 75 percentile level ($5 million), turnover probability would decrease to 14
      percent. In Chapter 2 we develop a model to describe the relationship between incentive and
      tenure in a principal-agent setting. One of the standard results of principal agent theories
      is that pay-for-performance sensitivity increases with the agent's tenure, but this has been
      rejected by prior empirical studies in CEO compensation literature. In our model, uncertainty
      dictates if the principal chooses input-based compensation or output-based compensation, where
      input-based compensation is less incentive intensive. We show that the principal is more
      likely to choose input-based compensation later in the agent's tenure. This demonstrates that
      pay-for-performance sensitivity decreases with the agent's tenure -result consistent with the
      prior empirical findings in the CEO compensation literature. Chapter 3 reexamines the
      relationship between pay-for-performance sensitivity and tenure using CEO compensation data.
      Our estimates indicate that there is a strong and positive relationship between
      pay-for-performance sensitivity and CEO tenure. For CEOs with tenure less than or equal to six
      years, an improvement in firm performance from the median level to the 75th percentile level
      would only lead to a 0.06 percent increase in total compensation. For CEOs with tenure of
      seven years or more, the same improvement in firm performance would lead to an 8 percent

               <mods:abstract>The lightcurves of variable DA and DB white dwarf stars are usually multiperiodic and
      non-sinusoidal, so that their Fourier transforms show peaks at eigenfrequencies of the
      pulsation modes and at sums and differences of these frequencies. These combination
      frequencies provide extra information about the pulsations, both physical and geometrical,
      that is lost unless they are analyzed. Several theories provide a context for this analysis by
      predicting combination frequency amplitudes. In these theories, the combination frequencies
      arise from nonlinear mixing of oscillation modes in the outer layers of the white dwarf, so
      their analysis cannot yield direct information on the global structure of the star as
      eigenmodes provide. However, their sensitivity to mode geometry does make them a useful tool
      for identifying the spherical degree of the modes that mix to produce them. In this
      dissertation, we analyze data from eight hot, low-amplitude DAV white dwarfs and measure the
      amplitudes of combination frequencies present. By comparing these amplitudes to the
      predictions of the theory of Goldreich and Wu, we have verified that the theory is crudely
      consistent with the measurements. We have also investigated to what extent the combination
      frequencies can be used to measure the spherical degree (l) of the modes that produce them. We
      find that modes with l &gt; 2 are easily identifiable as high ? based on their combination
      frequencies alone. Distinguishing between l = 1 and 2 is also possible using harmonics. These
      results will be useful for conducting seismological analyses of large ensembles of ZZ Ceti
      stars, such as those being discovered using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Because this method
      relies only on photometry at optical wavelengths, it can be applied to faint stars using 4 m
      class telescopes. We present new data from the 4.1 m Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope
      for the ZZ Ceti star L19-2. We use these data to determine the limits for application of this
      theory on data from a 4 m class telescope. We also analyze data for the hot, low-amplitude DBV
      EC 20058-5234 and demonstrate that the theory is applicable to both DAV and DBV white dwarf
      stars.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in a myriad of negative outcomes,
      but little is known about the effects of early TBI on social-behavioral functioning. Using
      parent report on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the current study compared
      socialbehavioral outcomes of 3-year-olds who sustained a TBI prior to the age of 2 to a
      typicallydeveloping comparison group. The study addressed the following questions: 1) Do
      parent ratings of the social-behavioral functioning of preschoolers who sustained mild and
      moderate/severe TBI as very young children differ significantly from parent ratings of
      typically developing preschoolers? 2) Do groups of preschoolers with mild and moderate/severe
      TBI differ significantly from a group of typically-developing children in their observed
      incidence of behavioral problems based on parent ratings? 3) What child-, family-, and
      injury-related variables (e.g., developmental level, maternal education, injury severity)
      predict Internalizing, Externalizing and Total Problem scores on parent ratings of the CBCL in
      preschoolers after TBI? No group differences emerged between the Mild TBI (n=31),
      Moderate/Severe TBI (n = 20), and Typically-Developing (n = 31) Groups on the CBCL; group
      means were average. In exploratory analyses, the TBI Group as a whole did not differ from the
      Typically-Developing Group on the CBCL. When breaking apart the Moderate/Severe Group in
      exploratory analyses, the Moderate Group demonstrated a non-significant trend toward greater
      impairment in overall development, adaptive behavior, and social-behavioral functioning.
      Exploratory regression equations revealed Glasgow Coma Scale and the Self-Report Family
      Inventory Leadership scale as predictors of Externalizing Problems; overall developmental
      level significantly predicted Internalizing Problems. Findings suggest that as preschoolers,
      children who sustained TBI at a very early age do not differ significantly in their
      social-behavioral functioning from one another or a comparison group. It is premature to infer
      that preschoolers do not evidence socialbehavioral dysfunction after early TBI. Future
      research must use larger samples to develop models for identifying children who might evidence
      social-behavioral problems post injury. Longitudinal research is needed to assess whether the
      lack of findings at age three might be related to environmental and task demands that may
      emerge. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The use of Lagrangian methods to model larval dispersal and define dispersal kernels
      and populations connectivity on the South East U.S. Continental Shelf is described. First,
      adjustments to the particle tracking algorithm are made to improve the separation rate of
      numerical drifters from observed drifters. Second, a comparison of observed and numerical
      drifter trajectories are used to provide a Lagrangian characterization of the circulation on
      the shelf. It is shown that, at certain times of year, retention might be quite high on the
      central part of the shelf. Third, 2D larval dispersal kernels are defined and the factors most
      important in determining these dispersal kernels are quantified. I look at a combination of 5
      factors: release time (month) and season, larval duration, release location, larval dispersion
      and larval behavior. Results indicate that adult behavior, in the form of spawning time and
      location, may be more important than larval behavior in determining larval dispersal on the
      inner- and mid- shelves in this region. Finally, I use a coupled biophysical model to look at
      the dispersal of black sea bass (Centropristis striata) larvae throughout the spawning season
      for 2002-2004.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis will discuss the generation of controlled sub-micron motions using novel
      micro actuators. Our research focuses on the development of an arm-type actuator and a
      free-motion locomotive walking device. Nano-science and nano-technology focuses on the
      creation of novel functional materials and also at the development of new fabrication
      techniques incorporating them. In the fields of novel fabrication techniques, manipulations of
      micron or sub-micron objects by micro actuators have been suggested in the science and
      engineering societies for mainly two reasons. From a scientific standpoint, new tools enable
      new prospective sciences, as is evident from the development of the atomic force microscope.
      From an engineering standpoint, the miniaturization of manipulation tools will require less
      material and less energy during a material's production. In spite of such importance, progress
      in the actuator miniaturization is in a primitive state, especially for the micro mobile
      devices. The thesis will be a key step in pursuit of this goal with an emphasis on generating
      motions. Our static actuator uses the excellent elastic properties of multiwall carbon
      nanotubes as a template for a bimorph system. Deflections in response to temperature
      variations are demonstrated. The mobile device itself is a bimorph system consisting of thin
      metal films. Control mechanisms for its velocity and steering are discussed. Finally,
      fundamental limits on the capabilities of the two devices in a more general sense are
      discussed under via laws of physics.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This work investigates various facets of migration and household demography in
      Thailand, a developing country that has been experiencing a shift from a rural subsistence
      economy to an urban industrial base. The setting is Nang Rong, a rural agrarian district
      located in Buriram province in the Northeast. At one time a frontier region, the district has
      been undergoing tremendous social, economic, and demographic transformations in the last three
      decades. The first analytical portion of the work deals with care for children of absent
      migrant parents. I develop a model of total childcare, whereby someone other than a biological
      parent assumes total parental responsibility in the parents' absence. I describe a process
      whereby a mutually-beneficial intergenerational household division of labor develops in which
      the older generation cares for the children of absent migrant parents, who provide for
      economic needs of their origin households. Next, using help with harvesting rice as an
      illustration of the profound changes that occur during the industrial transition, I examine
      intergenerational relations between young out-migrants and their parents. I find that migrants
      are more likely to help with the rice harvest if their origin household owns securely titled
      land, and if the migrant has lower human capital endowments. Results suggest that
      intergenerational relations between parents and children are becoming more instrumental, which
      is related to a household strategy predicated on individual self-interest and bargaining. The
      final analytical chapter deals with the effect of remittances on household division, a
      demographic process that is understudied in rural developing contexts. Results suggest that
      remittance money sent by other household members (especially women, who perhaps are siblings
      of those who eventually move) is used to finance a household split. This is potentially
      related to the effect that remittances have on alleviating credit constraints, which makes it
      possible for families and households to fund costs (such as home construction) associated with
      movement into an independent household. Remittance effects are particularly associated with a
      later stage in the Thai household life cycle whereby a young couple moves out of the household
      of the wife's family into an independent nuclear household.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In 1997 in the New Yorker, Sidney Harris published a cartoon depicting the
      "Ethel Mormon Tabernacle Choir" singing "There's NO business like
      SHOW business..." Besides the obvious play on the names of Ethel Merman and the
      Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the cartoon, in an odd way, is a true-to-life commentary on the image
      of the Salt Lake Mormon Tabernacle Choir (MTC) in the mid-1990s; at this time the Choir was
      seen as an entertainment ensemble, not just a church choir. This leads us to the central
      question of this dissertation, what changes took place in the latter part of the twentieth
      century to secularize the repertoire of the primary choir for the Church of Jesus Christ of
      Latter-day Saints (LDS)? In the 1860s, when the MTC began, its sole purpose was to perform for
      various church meetings, in particular for General Conference of the LDS church which was held
      in the Tabernacle at Temple Square in Salt Lake City. From the beginning of the twentieth
      century and escalating during the late 1950s to the early 1960s, the Choir's role changed from
      an in-house choir for the LDS church to a choir that also fulfilled a cultural and
      entertainment function, not only for the LDS church but also for the American public at large.
      The primary demarcation for this change is seen through the Choir's repertoire. Several major
      periods represent the change: (1) J. Spencer Cornwall's tenure (1935-1957) in which there was
      a creation of a core repertoire of mostly sacred works, (2) The increasing secularization of
      the Choir's repertoire during Columbia Records' recording contract with Richard P. Condie
      (1957-1974), and (3) The period under Jerold Ottley's direction (1974- 1999) in which there
      was a struggle to control the recording repertoire-which eventually led to the separation of
      the repertoire by Jerold Ottley into secular albums dictated by Columbia and sacred albums of
      Ottley's choice-which lasted until the end of the relationship between Columbia and the MTC.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation explores perceptions of the United States of America in the Soviet
      Union from the April 1945 meeting of Soviet and American soldiers on the river Elbe in Germany
      to the September 1959 visit of Premier N. S. Khrushchev to America. It uses a large body of
      archival sources to uncover multiple discourses about America in the Soviet Union, arguing
      that the Soviet state's America myths helped create a positive counter-myth of America.
      Chapter 1 introduces the state-sponsored anti-American campaign during the Stalin years and
      some of its most active participants. Chapter 2 addresses the effectiveness of the anti-
      American campaign as it uncovers an unofficial counter-myth that mirrored the anti- American
      propaganda promoted by Soviet authorities. In Chapter 3, considers official American
      propaganda during the Stalin era and shows how it contributed to the popular counter-myth that
      greatly distressed Soviet authorities. Chapter 4 examines the restored cultural relations with
      the United States, with a focus on the revival of Soviet-American cultural exchanges in 1955.
      Finally, Chapter 5 looks at Khrushchev's efforts to celebrate Soviet socialism while trying to
      maintain social order and promote the concept of peaceful coexistence with the United States.
      I conclude by considering Soviet perceptions of the United States in the 1960s and beyond,
      speculating on the meaning and importance of the myth of America in the Soviet Union and,
      after 1991, in Russia.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Many marine organisms are dispersed by water currents for all or part of their lives
      or utilize water currents to migrate between habitats as juveniles or adults. This transport
      is an important determinant of the distribution of marine populations and can be significantly
      influenced by organisms' vertical migratory behaviors (VMBs). The importance of VMBs to
      transport is now widely recognized, but there have been relatively few attempts to give
      detailed descriptions of them or quantify their influence. This dissertation describes and
      quantifies the influence of ebb-tide transport (ETT), a VMB in which crabs ascend into the
      water column during ebb tides, on the spawning migration of female blue crabs Callinectes
      sapidus, near Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina. Ovigerous female crabs were tracked with
      ultrasonic telemetry. A detailed behavioral model was developed from this study as well as
      other field and laboratory studies and was coupled to a hydrodynamic model of the Beaufort
      Inlet region. The total distances that crabs traveled during ebb tides ranged from 10 - 40 %
      of the distances that passive particles would have traveled under the same conditions. This
      dissertation also describes and quantifies the influence of diel vertical migration (DVM), a
      common VMB in which organisms reside in near-surface waters at night and at deeper depths
      during the day, on the transport of zooplankton in a coastal region with strong iii seasonal
      upwelling. Simple behavioral models of zooplankton DVM were coupled to a hydrodynamic model of
      the Monterey Bay region of California. DVM reduced transport away from the region by as much
      as 8 km d-1 relative to passive transport near the surface. A synthesis of the existing
      literature supports the assumptions that selective tidal-stream transport behaviors such as
      ETT enable directed migrations in estuarine and coastal regions while DVM and ontogenetic
      vertical migrations generally retain organisms near their starting locations. The synthesis
      also demonstrated that quantification of the influence of VMBs on transport must be carried
      out for specific behaviors at specific locations because organisms' characteristic VMBs and
      hydrography vary widely between marine environments.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>An exact mathematical solution for the low Reynolds number, quasi steady, hydrodynamic
      motion induced by a rod in the form of a prolate spheroid sweeping a double cone is developed
      and the influence of the ensuing fluid motion upon passive particles is studied. The resulting
      fluid motion is fully three-dimensional and time-varying. The advected particles are observed
      to admit slow orbits around the rotating rods and a fast epicyclic motion roughly commensurate
      with the rod rotation rate. The epicycle amplitudes, vertical fluctuations, arclengths, and
      angle traveled per rotation are mapped as functions of their initial coordinates and rod
      geometry. These trajectories exhibit a rich spatial structure with greatly varying trajectory
      properties. We examine these complexities via an auxiliary flow in the rotating frame which
      provides a generator that defines the epicycles. Further, an additional spin around the major
      spheroidal axis is included in the exact hydrodynamic solution. This exact solution is
      compared to an asymptotic solution for a slender body sweeping a double cone by carefully
      assessing how slenderness affects the domain in which trajectories and flow properties can be
      accurately captured. By utilizing slender body theory and a family of singularities developed
      for Stokes flow past a no-slip plane, an asymptotic solution for a slender body attached to a
      plane rotating about its base sweeping out an upright cone is constructed. Trajectory and flow
      properties are examined with special attention paid to iii the case study on slenderness
      between the exact and asymptotic free space solutions. Far field asymptotic analysis is
      presented for both the exact free space and the asymptotic no-slip plane velocity solutions.
      The present study is of direct use to nano-scale actuated fluidics where similar epicyclical
      behavior has been observed. On such scales, thermal fluctuations and Brownian motion are
      observed and the proper interpretation of experimental measurements relies on the ability for
      accurate predictions of the deterministic component of the hydrodynamics. Through dynamic
      similarity, analysis of a table top experiment performed by the UNC RMX group validates the
      mathematical theory and allows for direct comparison to the microscale.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Species richness is the number of species in a given area or sample and is the most
      fundamental measure of biodiversity. It results from the aggregation of individual species
      whose distributions are influenced by processes operating on a wide range of scales.
      Estimating and understanding species richness at landscape scales (103-106 ha) is not easily
      achieved from small sample areas that can be completely inventoried. In particular the spatial
      structure of environments makes the richness observations across a landscape non-additive.
      This dissertation develops the vital links between the spatial structure of ecological factors
      that are hypothesized to control species richness, spatial variation in species composition,
      and the sampling strategies used to measure species richness. I present a method for
      objectively and iteratively assessing patterns of biodiversity. This method builds upon
      "ecological zipcodes" that classify the landscape by energy flux,
      temperature, and precipitation. I also present a model of human energetic expenditure during
      walking that can be applied at landscape scales. I use this model to analyze sampling bias
      associated with accessibility for vegetation surveys. I used both the "ecological
      zipcodes" and the model of accessibility to design efficient and representative
      biodiversity samples based on clustered-stratified sampling. Finally, I assess the reliability
      of richness estimators that incorporate turnover in species composition. My results illustrate
      that efficient and representative richness assessment is possible, even with little a priori
      knowledge about the spatial structure of species richness. They also demonstrate that typical
      biodiversity assessments show a strong bias in accessibility that is both a product of the
      spatial structuring of samples as well as environment. This bias is significant even for small
      biases in sample accessibility. Also, I show that though clustered sampling designs capture
      multiple scales of aggregation, their representativeness is very sensitive to stratification.
      Finally, my results show that species richness estimates that incorporate turnover are
      confounded by the interaction between sample size and environmental heterogeneity. Only when
      controlling for these effects, can information about the spatial turnover in species
      composition be effective in estimating species richness.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study attempts to analyze the economic effects of the domestic slave trade and
      the slave traders on the American South in a broader Atlantic context. In so doing, it
      interprets the trade as a sophisticated business and traders as speculative, entrepreneurial
      businessmen. The majority of southern planters were involved in the slave trade and relied on
      it to balance their financial security. They evaluated their slaves in cash terms, and made
      strategic decisions regarding buying and selling their property to enhance the overall
      productivity of their plantations in the long run. Slave traders acquired business skills in
      the same manner as did merchants in other trades, utilizing new forms of financial options in
      order to maximize their profit and taking advantage of the market revolution in transportation
      and communication methods in the same ways that contemporary northern entrepreneurs did. They
      were capable of making rational moves according to the signals of global commodity markets and
      financial movements. The slave trade eventually played a central role in determining the fate
      of the South, as a business that created a unified South under proslavery ideology and
      encouraged western migration to preserve the institution of slavery. In a time of western
      expansion and the cotton boom, some slave traders were able to accumulate great wealth from
      the slave-trading business and sought opportunities to acquire higher social status and
      financial stability. Through the case of Rice C. Ballard, who was able to make the transition
      from a slave trader in Virginia to a cotton planter in the West, this dissertation will show
      that skills and networks established from the slave-trading business enabled the traders to
      acquire managerial abilities and the ethos associated with nascent global capitalism. They
      were able to develop awareness and knowledge of commercial networks beyond the South and
      operated with an expansive mindset to adapt to the increasingly integrated global economy of
      the early nineteenth century.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In "The Test of Salt Water": Literature of the Sea and Social Class
      in Antebellum America, I argue that fictional and non-fictional antebellum sea literature
      offers a valuable lens through which to critique authorial responses to race, social class,
      and economic mobility. The antebellum sailor populating the pages of the sea narrative was
      often celebrated as a representative American figure and a source of national pride despite
      the fact that, as a member of the antebellum working classes, he was a living testament to the
      limits of economic and social advancement in a nation where such limits were supposedly
      nonexistent. Authors used this disconnect, as well as the extra-national settings and generic
      conventions unique to the sea narrative, both to illuminate foundational American ideals and
      expose the failure of those ideals to improve materially the lives of sailors. In first
      section of The Test of Salt Water, I draw on writings by common sailors as well as wellknown
      narratives authored by upper-class former seamen such as James Fenimore Cooper and Richard
      Henry Dana to map the rhetorical battles that helped to define the sailor within antebellum
      class hierarchies. In the second section, I evaluate sea narratives by Herman Melville,
      Frederick Douglass, and Martin Delany, each of whom utilized the sailor's social and economic
      marginality to investigate the racial dimensions of class, labor, and freedom. Ultimately,
      these authors confront the limits of opportunity for many Americans by positioning the sailor
      as a liminal figure who-despite showing qualities of both-is neither slave nor citizen.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation consists of two essays. In "A Life-Cycle Model: Retirement,
      Savings, and Portfolio Allocation", I analyze the interrelationships among
      retirement, saving, and asset allocation. I show that optimal portfolio allocation can be very
      sensitive to plans about retirement timing and to the presence and characteristics of Social
      Security. I also show how portfolio decisions have impact on when to retire. In order to take
      into account these important effects, Social Security reform proposals should be evaluated
      with models that incorporate portfolio choice. In the second essay, "Asset
      Allocation, Bequests, and Wealth Dynamics of the Elderly", I build and estimate a
      life cycle model of asset allocation and saving with a fixed cost of stock market entry,
      medical expenditure risk, and a general bequest function that captures risk preferences over
      bequests. The estimates imply that there is no operative bequest motive, and that medical
      expenditure risk is a very strong motivation for saving at older ages. Even though the model
      explains reasonably well both the observed average age profiles and the heterogeneity in
      saving and portfolio allocation, the cross-equation restrictions that are required for
      internal consistency are strongly rejected. This is mainly due to the fact that, in constant
      relative risk aversion utility, a single parameter - coefficient of relative risk aversion -
      governs both wealth and portfolio paths. While a very high level of risk aversion is required
      to explain portfolio choices, a very low level of risk aversion is required to explain wealth
      dynamics. Despite its internal inconsistency, the model is one of the richest versions of the
      standard model and I use the estimates to do some policy simulations with caution. I used the
      estimates to simulate the impact of reducing the Social Security benefit of a 70-year old
      female retiree by a specific amount, and giving her a lump sum equal to the expected present
      discounted value of the benefit cut, which is to be invested in her individual account. I find
      that this reform would be undesirable. Main reason behind this is that, most retirees are
      either optimally annuitized or under-annuitized.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS) are a class of semiconductors where a mag- netic
      ion has been randomly but substitutionally doped into a conventional semicon- ductor. DMS are
      currently envisioned as a key ferromagnetic material to be used in the construction of
      spintronic devices, or devices which operate based on the spin of spin-polarized charge
      carriers. I report primarily on magnetic characterization of Ga1-xMnxAs, and additionally on
      structural characterization of Ga1-xMnxN, examples of (III,Mn)V DMS. Magnetic Raman scattering
      experiments performed on Ga1¡xMnxN were unsuccessful. Results from magnetic Brillouin light
      scattering (BLS) measurements of Ga1-xMnxAs include the angular- and field-dependence of
      magnon (spin-wave) frequencies and the resulting description of magnetocrystalline anisotropy;
      dependence of magnon frequency on Mn content, temperature, and incident laser power; and the
      observation of surface magnon modes. Transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (t-MOKE)
      measurements provide an additional perspective on magne- tocrystalline anisotropy and serve to
      completely eliminate the possibility of a description in terms of the Stoner-Wohlfarth
      single-domain model.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Within the sociometric tradition, popularity has been defined as being widely
      well-liked by peers. Sociometrically popular students display a host of prosocial behaviors
      that contribute to typically positive developmental outcomes. Recently, researchers have begun
      to challenge this notion and have suggested that students who are named as popular by their
      peers are not necessarily well-liked and friendly, cooperative, and helpful. Instead, they
      demonstrate a blend of positive social conduct coupled with elevated levels of social
      aggression, bullying, and risk-taking behaviors. This group has been termed 'perceived
      popular'. The present study examined 3rd and 4th grade students (n=1,359) based on popular
      group membership assigned through sociometric techniques. Students were assigned to one of
      four popular groups: 1) Sociometrically Popular; 2) Perceived Popular; 3) Both Perceived and
      Sociometrically Popular; or 4) Not Popular. Social self-perceptions, self-concept, and
      peerreported social behaviors were investigated over two data collection time points spanning
      an academic year. Significant between-group differences existed on all measures at the outset
      of the study. Stability versus change in popularity over the school year differentially
      influenced peer-reported social behaviors but not social self-perceptions or self-concept
      depending on popular group assignment at Time 1. Peer-reported leadership was shown to have a
      mediating effect on the relationship between prosocial and Machiavellian social success, while
      bullying appeared to strongly influence students' social acceptance. Implications for
      intervention development and future research agendas are discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Two key theoretical themes guided my exploration of neighborhood change. First, I
      utilized the classic sociological notion of social distance in testing its determinants and
      viewing its effect on neighborhood change over time. I measured social distance in various
      manners: 1) racial/ethnic differences, 2) a composite of several characteristics (including
      racial/ethnic, socio-economic, and demographic), or 3) the consolidated inequality created by
      difference along both racial/ethnic and socio-economic differences simultaneously. Second, I
      built an explicit micro-level theory of household residential mobility decisions to explain
      the generation of the structural characteristics that theories posit cause neighborhood crime.
      I found that social distance had important implications for neighborhoods. Using a
      multi-level, longitudinal sample of the American Housing Survey (AHS) I found that
      individual-level social distance along multiple characteristics helps explain neighborhood
      satisfaction: this suggests the importance of focusing on the fit of the household with the
      neighborhood. Dynamic analyses using this same sample showed that racial/ethnic heterogeneity
      explains crime rates four years later. Fixed effects analyses using a sample of census tracts
      in eleven cities found that changing ethnic heterogeneity over the decade is positively
      related to changing crime rates. These same fixed effects analyses showed that increasing
      inequality between African-Americans and whites is positively related to the change in various
      official crime rates. My theoretical model helped explain the change in neighborhood
      structural characteristics. Using the AHS sample, I found that perceived crime in a block
      increases general residential mobility. This theoretical model also predicted and found that
      the presence of more homeowners on a block reduces perceived crime four years later in dynamic
      models. While residential instability had no effect on crime four years later in cross-lagged
      models, more vacant units in the block are positively related to perceived crime four years
      later. This suggests a possible manner in which residential mobility may affect neighborhood
      crime rates. I also found using the AHS sample that higher levels of block perceived crime
      creates racial/ethnic residential transformation by increasing the likelihood that
      African-Americans and Latinos will move into the block, and reducing the likelihood that
      whites will move in.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation advances our understanding of the enduring theoretical question of
      why certain people participate in activism while others do not. Contrary to prior theoretical
      and empirical models of differential participation, it specifies and tests a synthetic model
      of activism, integrating dispositional and relational perspectives. Because these perspectives
      have generally been pursued in isolation, our knowledge of the processes that explain activist
      participation has been limited. Combining dispositional and relational perspectives offers a
      more comprehensive view of activism by showing how these perspectives work in concert to
      mobilize people to participate in volunteer efforts in communities. My synthetic model of
      activism has the additional strength of addressing the important issue of selection versus
      influence concerning social network and organization effects. This dissertation also examines
      the demobilizing character of social networks and organizations, which has generally gone
      unnoticed in scholarship on activist participation until recently. It does so for the case of
      religious-based activism, considering the hindering effects of integration into quiescent
      clergy-led congregations and embeddedness in "bonding" religious networks.
      In addition, this dissertation explicates the pathways through which congregations promote
      participation in civic engagement in communities, focusing on exposure to encouragement from
      activist clergy, location in activist religious peer networks, and cultivation of transposable
      skills. Last, this dissertation focuses on the nature of civic response after the September 11
      terrorist attacks, investigating whether tragedy-related factors promoted involvement in
      efforts to help victims, families of victims, or rescue workers as well as others in
      communities. It also considers how prosocial dispositions shaped Americans' responses to 9/11
      and how these responses in turn affected post-9/11 helping behavior as well as the precise
      dimensions of social networks and organization that were most important for mobilizing
      participation in helping behavior after the 9/11 tragedy.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Newspaper newsrooms in the 1990s, hard-hit by financial pressures and steady declines
      in circulation, sought ways to be more efficient and attract more readers. One result was the
      creation of topic teams: groups of journalists assigned to produce reports on topics deemed to
      be of interest to targeted readers. As newspapers reorganized to enable such teams, newsrooms
      became more participatory and less authoritarian, altering decades of journalistic routines,
      culture, and job descriptions. Although the first experimenters were greeted with jeers and
      suspicion, topic-team newsrooms were widespread by the turn of the century. This study is the
      first to contextualize the adoption of topic teams in the United States in terms of history
      and journalistic experience. In-depth interviews with topic-team journalists yielded insights
      into management, professional values, newsroom practices, and the interaction of all three.
      Within a continuum, three types of teams emerged: negative, cohesive, and synergistic.
      Negative teams, which were the least functional, were associated with the highest degree of
      management control and the lowest degree of reward for the team member. Synergistic teams
      offered the highest reward with the least degree of management control. Cohesive teams were
      moderate in both regards. Management risk appeared greatest at both extremes. A model of topic
      team instrumentality, using these findings, is proposed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study of Changó by Zapata Olivella shows a worldview, an ideology that is neither
      strictly Western nor strictly rational. Thus my interest in this work rests on the author's
      creative ability to devote Changó to changing conventions. In attempting to valuate négritude,
      the author re-appropriates this literary movement, purges it of the Manichaeism it adopted
      from the dialectic of European ideologies of hierarchy of thoughts which assert that European
      is analytical and Black pre-logical. Zapata Olivella thereby establishes a more nuanced and
      complex set of relationships in négritude. Set in this ideological framework, Changó is a
      model of négritude discourse which harmoniously blends indigénisme and negrismo in a
      historiographic metafictional intertextuality where orality, writing, history, politics, and
      anthropology come together in defiance of linear writing. As such, Changó is a discourse with
      social visions which does not overlook the dynamism of black political ideologies but takes
      into consideration the recombinant qualities of black Atlantic's affirmative, sociopolitical
      cultures.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>For the counterculture of the 1960s and 70s, rock music was not only mass
      entertainment, but also a form of public life. While many scholars have argued that rock was
      incompatible with civic participation, this book claims that in music scenes such as San
      Francisco, in poster art and dancing, on the radio and in print publications, rock served as a
      flash point for dilemmas of citizenship and civil society. As frequently as it deteriorated
      into escapism and hedonism, rock also created an atmosphere of inquiry in which the young
      might listen, think, move, and feel their way through issues of public and civic interaction,
      such as identity, belonging, power, and democracy. Even when exported by the American military
      to Vietnam or when circulating to youth movements worldwide, far from eclipsing public life,
      rock music transformed it into a mass-mediated mode of association that prefigured the civics
      of global society.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation assesses the theory of value underpinning cost-benefit analysis.
      This theory of value consists of two main claims. The first is that the satisfaction of
      individual preferences is what counts as a benefit and their frustration is what counts as a
      cost. This is standardly purported to be the case because satisfying individual preferences
      promotes individual well-being and, in turn, social welfare. I argue that there is a close
      connection between well-being and preference satisfaction: an individual's well-being consists
      in the satisfaction of her fully-informed and rational preferences. However, I maintain that
      there may be occasions where a person's actual preferences would, if satisfied, diminish her
      wellbeing and where the state is a better judge than the person herself of what would enhance
      her well-being. On such occasions, the state should strive to make people informed and
      rational (in the relevant respects), and then after doing so, attend to and promote the
      satisfaction of the preferences they then have. This has the effect enhancing individual
      well-being, and does so in a way that respects individual autonomy. This is fundamentally
      compatible with CBA. The second claim is that all costs and benefits - including human lives
      lost or preserved, as well as changes affecting human health and comfort, the cleanliness of
      air and water, the welfare of non-human species, and ecological services rendered - can be
      expressed monetarily. I maintain that an individual's willingness to pay or to accept a
      certain amount of money for a good does not suffice to show that this good's value can be
      monetized. With respect to certain goods, an individual can have preferences that differ from
      one another along multiple irreducible dimensions. Different preferences will sometimes
      incorporate fundamentally distinct attitudes such as appreciation, fascination, respect,
      agitation, disgust, and shame. Thus, there will be pairs of goods of which it can be said
      neither that one member is simply more valuable than the other nor that the members are equal
      in value. This means that rational preferences cannot generate a single ordering of value,
      monetary or otherwise.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation asks how thinking about language can help us think about, and
      perhaps think differently about, education. Based on interviews with practicing classroom
      teachers who are also alumnae of a Master's in Education degree program for Experienced
      Teachers, in this work teachers describe encounters with various languages of education,
      including administrative languages and languages of the academy. Based in Bronwyn Davies'
      (2000) assertion that theorizing language allows us to make visible and disrupt our
      positioning through language, thereby repositioning ourselves, this study interprets practices
      of education through theories of language to explore both the contradictions and the
      possibilities for change that are revealed when languages of education are theorized. Located
      at the nexus of phenomenology, philosophical anthropology, and literary criticism, this work
      applies a postmodern hermeneutics (Nash, 1997) to the study of languages of education. Texts
      of teacher interviews were put into conversation with other key texts that inform thinking in
      education. Arguing that contemporary politics of education block meaningful conversations
      among educators, this work also confronts reductions of language that reduce practice. This
      work advances Kristeva's (1984) notion of the semiotic for its potential to open up and expand
      discursive situations and positions in education.</mods:abstract>

               </mods:language>
               <mods:abstract>Since the mid-1980s, Francophone authors from both the Eastern and Western worlds have
      displayed a renewed interest in Scheherazade, the legendary storyteller of Les Mille et Une
      Nuits. This rediscovery of Scheherazade, particularly in the postcolonial context, serves as a
      vehicle for refuting hegemonic and patriarchal domination. As a multicultural figure,
      Scheherazade also functions as a means through which sexuality and maternity can be redefined.
      Furthermore, Scheherazade's recent renown is inextricably linked to the impact of
      globalization and multiculturalism in the information age, wherein the emblem of the empowered
      literary and political icon is available to all, regardless of race, gender, or geographical
      location. The title character in each of the primary sources I examine in this dissertation is
      overtly named after Scheherazade. Although these primary works share a common namesake,
      however, the cultural, religious, ethnic and ethical values relating to the women within them
      vary considerably. The five novels and four short stories in which the Scheherazade figures
      appear were written over a span of twenty-one years, by both male and female authors from
      Algeria/France, Canada, and Switzerland. In Leïla Sebbar's seven Shérazade works, the
      Scheherazade figure is an educated, powerful and defiant Beur runaway who is the
      quintessential anti-odalisque. Shérazade overcomes death and rape, ultimately becoming a
      mother-figure in contemporary Algeria. In Le Nombril de Scheherazade, Pierre Karch reinvents
      Scheherazade as a pseudo-transvestite storyteller in the Bahamas. Karch's abundant use of
      parody forces the reader to question the cultural construct of gender while simultaneously
      calling attention to dysfunctional family dynamics. In the case of Vinciane Moeschler's
      Schéhérazade, ma folie, both parodic Scheherazade figures succumb to languor, dependency and
      despondency. By presenting two illfated narratives of excess, one in Medieval Baghdad and
      another in contemporary Algiers and Brussels, Moeschler offers a diachronic reproachment of
      female hypersexuality and Western misperceptions of the East. In addition to subverting
      Orientalist stereotypes of Scheherazade, Sebbar, Karch and Moeschler refute the binary
      opposition between sexuality and maternity, thereby proferring a redefinition of women's
      voice, power and identity in the twenty-first century.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Reliable public communication before, during, and after a crisis can save lives and
      protect property, yet scholarly research has neglected crisis communication in the public
      sector, particularly from an organizational perspective. To begin to fill this void, this
      dissertation employed the qualitative methods of participant observation and in-depth
      interviews to analyze the organizational practices of state emergency management agencies'
      (SEMA) public affairs offices. An understanding of the roles that public affairs officers have
      in supporting SEMA's mission of disaster mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery
      emerged from the data analysis. The public affairs office had two distinct personalities while
      operating under routine conditions and under crisis conditions. As a result, this research
      presents a new model to explain how SEMA public affairs offices shift into disaster mode.
      Crisis Adaptive Public Information (CAPI) accounts for two distinct operational philosophies
      and explains the transitional nature of this type of organization as it reacts to a crisis
      stimulus. CAPI incorporates chaos theory as a means of interpreting a crisis event and the
      concept of high reliability organizations as a means of interpreting the public affairs
      office's organizational behavior. This model considers the specific organizational environment
      of SEMAs and provides a new theoretical foundation for further exploration of this vital area
      of public communication.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Recent histories of the University of North Carolina trivialize the institution's
      support for white supremacy during slavery, Reconstruction, and Jim Crow, while denying that
      this unjust past affects the university today. The celebratory lens also filters out African
      American contributions to the university. In fact, most credit for UNC's increased diversity
      is due to the struggles of African Americans and other traditionally disenfranchised groups
      for equal rights. During both the 1860s and the1960s, black freedom movements promoted norms
      of democratic citizenship and institutional responsibility that challenged the university to
      become more honest, more inclusive, and more just. By censoring this historical viewpoint,
      previous scholarship has contributed to a culture of denial and racial historical amnesia that
      heralds UNC as the "University of the People," without seriously engaging
      questions of justice in the past or the present. This dissertation demonstrates that before
      1865, the gentry used the university to promote the growth of slavery. Following Emancipation,
      university trustees led the white supremacy campaign to suppress black freedom and Radical
      Reconstruction. At the turn of the century, university leaders organized the movement for
      black disfranchisement and segregation that led to Jim Crow. Until the 1960s, the university
      enforced Jim Crow in its employment practices and its relations with the Town of Chapel Hill.
      Throughout its history, black workers were the main force challenging UNC's institutional
      racism on campus, in Chapel Hill, and throughout the state. An extended Epilogue examines how
      the university's institutional culture changed during the 1960s from an open defense of Jim
      Crow to acceptance of non-discrimination. Although the university accepted formal equality in
      admissions, employment, and its relations with the larger community, it did not acknowledge or
      attempt to dismantle the institutional structures of white supremacy that it had helped to
      create throughout its history. In this way, UNC established a paradigm of diversity without
      justice to replace Jim Crow, replacing the open celebration of white supremacy with new forms
      of subtle, "colorblind" institutional racism that persist today.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Cocaine addiction in humans is characterized by cycles of abstinence from drug-taking
      behavior and resumption of drug consumption (relapse). Numerous studies have implicated the
      brain 'reward' circuit, including the nucleus accumbens (Acb) and associated brain regions, in
      mediating drug-seeking behaviors. Using electrophysiological recording procedures in behaving
      rodents, we have shown that Acb neurons encode information about key aspects of goal-directed
      behaviors. Moreover, we have shown that cell firing in this region is sensitive to
      interruption (extinction) of response-reinforcement contingencies involving drug or natural
      rewards. To extend these findings to a more clinically relevant model, electrophysiological
      recording procedures were used here to determine the firing properties of Acb neurons
      following abstinence (i.e., experimenter-controlled removal of drug access) from cocaine
      self-administration. Experiments in Chapter 2 revealed that the percentage of Acb cells that
      encode cocaine-seeking behavior is dramatically increased during resumption of cocaine
      self-administration following 1-month cocaine abstinence. Extinction experiments in another
      set of rats revealed an increased motivational state for the drug following 1-month
      abstinence. Studies in Chapter 3 showed that these effects were also observed in animals that
      underwent extended (2-month) abstinence from cocaine self-administration. Since there were
      possible confounding variables such as increased age and extended time of microwire
      implantation for the 2-month group, appropriate controls were included in this experiment. The
      ability of cocaine-associated stimuli to elicit drug-seeking even after years of abstinence is
      problematic for addicts who wish to remain drug-free. In Chapter 4 we show that activation of
      Acb neurons by cocaine-associated stimuli was enhanced following 1-month cocaine abstinence
      regardless of contingency of cue presentation or cocaine availability. Taken together, our
      results show that 1- and 2-month abstinence from cocaine self-administration causes a dramatic
      increase in the number and strength of Acb neurons that encode cocaine-related information
      (Chapters 2 &amp; 3), and that Acb neurons are more responsive to cocaine-associated cues
      following 1-month abstinence across multiple environmental contexts (Chapter 4). Overall, the
      present report highlights cellular changes in the Acb following cocaine abstinence that may
      represent one type of neuroadapation related to cocaine taking and abstinence from drug use
      underlying the inability of cocaine addicts to remain drug free.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This is a study of the intersection of law and ethics as they address the professional
      practice of journalism. When the United States Supreme Court had occasion to address
      journalism's five fundamental ethical principles in cases decided from 1947 through 2005, its
      rulings were supportive of these principles in general, but not universally so, or in all
      their particular applications. In some respects, the Court created a legal basis for rendering
      some principles practical nullities and undermined others so significantly that some ethical
      prescriptions are perhaps less likely to be followed by professional journalists of the 21st
      century and beyond. This study identifies the following as the five principles and directives
      of journalism ethics: tell the truth, respect privacy, report the news, protect sources and
      maintain independence. This study has found that in some instances, the Court has denigrated
      journalism's most cherished principles in deference to other ideals the Court has found more
      important.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Legal proof comes under scrutiny in theatrical criminal trials in early
      seventeenthcentury England. I maintain that probability is a bundle of related concepts that
      have received different emphases in different cultures at different times; that the practice
      of adjudicating alleged crimes via England's adversarial, jury-oriented, and performance-based
      system involved both established and emerging concepts of probability; and that plays
      including Ben Jonson's Volpone, John Webster's The White Devil, and Shakespeare's Measure for
      Measure expressed some of the tensions concerning these differentiated notions and the
      practices that relied on them. Practices consistent with the modern meanings of probability
      were already present in the law courts of early modern England, though they were articulated
      according to older, rhetoric-based definitions of probability or labeled as something other
      than probability. This elasticity in the way probability is conceived and put to use shows up
      in the three plays under consideration here. Volpone mocks the tools which triers of fact use
      to gauge witness credibility-oathtaking, consideration of reputation, expectations about how
      guilty or innocent people "act" in court-and satirizes the expectations that
      jurors share about what guilt should look like and the "show" the accused
      should put on, thus incarnating an everyday kind of "expectation"
      probability that becomes the focus of the mathematicians' attempts to devise a calculus
      modeled on "the reasonable man" later in the seventeenth century. In The
      White Devil the drawing of inferences from circumstantial evidence in Vittoria's trial invokes
      the same kind of probabilistic reasoning which supposedly bolsters jury verdicts, yet the
      performativity of her testimony complicates the probability underlying law's epistemology of
      near-certainty. Measure for Measure reifies the epistemological or degree-of-belief
      probability inherent in the emerging standard of proof-the "satisfied
      conscience," yet in the depiction of the processes of judgment also explores a
      skeptic's argument against law's claim to near-certainty.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Construal Level Theory (CLT) proposes that social distance will operate similarly to
      temporal distance in that individuals' perceptions of others will be high level, abstract
      construals, and individuals' own perceptions will be low level, concrete construals (at least
      for the near future; Liberman, Trope, and Stephan in press, Trope and Liberman 2003).
      Consequently individuals will predict that desirability considerations are more important to
      others than to self, and will indicate that feasibility considerations are more important to
      self than to others. Four studies show this effect by examining the prediction of others'
      preferences, and the choices people make on behalf of others. These studies replicate the
      effect using different manipulations of desirability considerations (i.e., importance of
      brands in general, a specific brand of a consumer product, and attributes of a consumer
      product and experience) as well as feasibility considerations (i.e., importance of value in
      general, the price of a consumer product, and attributes of a consumer product and
      experience). Therefore, the effect is not driven solely by individuals' perceptions that they
      are more price sensitive than others, but rather results from perceived differences between
      self and others in the importance of the tradeoff between desirability and feasibility
      considerations. Results also indicate that closeness of the relationship to the other to the
      self is a moderator of the effect such that the effect is attenuated as the relationship to
      the other becomes closer to the self (i.e., average other vs. friend). Because individuals
      perceive that others value desirability considerations, results show that they report
      different preferences (i.e., preferences favoring desirability considerations) for themselves
      in public than they do in private. Consequently, the self-other difference not only influences
      the choices individuals make for others, but also the choices they make for themselves in
      different social settings. Two final studies examine representation of the other (i.e., level
      of concrete representation) as the underlying mechanism for the self-other effect. No
      conclusive evidence is found that a concrete representation attenuates the self-other effect.
      Future directions and managerial implications are discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>"Female Hospitallers in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries" is an
      analysis of the presence of female members in the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, who
      were associated with the order as lay sisters involved in hospital care, as women devoted to
      the liturgy, and as commanders. The study gives special attention to the differences among
      types of female association, the accommodation of female religious, the cooperation between
      men and women (or lack thereof), and motivation. It is the first large-scale study of women in
      the military orders in English and first serious attempt to relate the study of military
      orders to the framework of the study of female monasticism. With predominantly archival
      sources as her evidence, the author argues that, 1. the female members of the Hospital of
      Saint John were not an anomaly to the order but formed an integral part of the order, as they
      contributed financially, physically, socially, and above all, spiritually; 2. the Hospital of
      Saint John was, in comparison to other religious orders, remarkably open to receiving and
      accommodating women. Some of these women associated as fully-professed religious, others as
      lay associates or semi-religious; consorores, donatas, or the like, depending on when or where
      the association was made. At the end of the twelfth century and in line with a general trend
      in the history of monasticism, the Order of Saint John began to segregate the women from the
      men and established religious houses specifically for them. However, this segregation was
      never complete, and unlike most other religious orders, the Hospitallers continued to welcome
      female association in male, female, and mixed-sex congregations throughout the thirteenth
      century. Its positive attitude towards women was only matched by other Augustinian
      institutions, and points at a difference between Augustinian and Cistercian-Benedictine
      oriented military religious orders.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Art Historians describe Heade's paintings of hummingbirds in two very different ways:
      first, as highly realistic, even scientific, representations of the natural world, and second,
      as spiritual, sensual, phantasmagorical explorations suggestive of something more-in short, of
      revelations of the artist himself. Foregrounding Heade's paintings of hummingbirds, Wondrous
      Creatures investigates each of these ways of understanding and what they reveal about Heade
      and his works. Beginning in 1862, Heade painted at least 120 pictures of hummingbirds,
      glittering birds painted large and close before alluring tropical landscapes. En route, Heade
      had painted children in flight, landscapes populated with haystacks and light, flowers snipped
      and arranged in decorative vases, and sober portraits. He left a country rent by civil war,
      traveling to a land of promise to document the hummingbird, then on to England where he showed
      portraits of fairylike birds alongside British paintings of 'real' fairies. Each stop along
      this path shaped the outcome; Wondrous Creatures looks beneath the glaze of documentary
      realism to consider their contributions at depth. Wondrous Creatures triangulates art history,
      the history of natural science, and cultural studies to expose the suggestions in Heade's
      paintings. The process depends on identifying the substitutions and transformations evident in
      Heade's oeuvre, wherein spiritual ornithology becomes naturalistic fantasy, hummingbirds
      becomes fairies, orchids becomes animistic giants, children becomes hummingbirds, and
      landscape becomes a stage 'peopled' with haystacks, humans, or hummingbirds. The dissertation
      asserts that, in depicting the hummingbird, Heade rapidly exceeded the boundaries of natural
      history painter, becoming also a storyteller, portraitist, Pre-Raphaelite painter, at times
      even a fairy painter, his gleaming images describing the ways that his tiny special pets love
      deeply, battle furiously, and hum with sexuality even while varnished with the innocence of
      the child. Asserting that birds, like all animals, were emptied of any innate meaning by the
      end of the eighteenth century to make room for nostalgia, narrative, and symbolic usage, and
      considering the works and their subjects within their historical and cultural context,
      Wondrous Creatures asserts that Heade stuffed depictions of natural elements densely with
      legible, if poetically concealed, human meanings.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Explanations for the extensive variation in rates of entrepreneurship across countries
      and gender have been biased by the dominant paradigms of the field, the limits of the
      resulting research designs, and ultimately by the lack of a comprehensive multilevel
      theoretical framework for predicting and understanding the decision to start a business. I
      propose an alternative view of entrepreneurship based on contemporary social theory; in
      particular on Bourdieu's theory of practice. The resulting practice theory model provides a
      set of theoretical propositions and hypotheses that fit well with existing evidence from the
      field of entrepreneurship and from other studies of gender and work. Results from a series of
      2-level random coefficient models investigating the relative impacts of micro- and macro-level
      correlates of nascent entrepreneurship strongly support a practice theory view of
      entrepreneurship. The capital structures -- economic, cultural, social and symbolic -- that
      define social positions explain most of the gender variation and a large extent of the
      variation across countries. Country characteristics also explain a good portion of the country
      variation. Perceptions, social ties, and national gender culture are significant correlates of
      nascent entrepreneurship, net of all other micro- and macro-level factors. The variation in
      rates of nascent entrepreneurship is more extensive across countries than across gender.
      Micro-macro interactions are also explored.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation interprets the stories of five African American educators and the
      ways in which they view and experience manifestations of race and racism in schools. Guided by
      a critical race methodology that frames race as an analytical lens for research conducted on
      the work and lives of people of color, the researcher conducted in-depth, phenomenological
      interviews as well as a focus group with the educators to investigate their day-to-day
      experiences as they attempt to navigate the processes and discourses in schools through which
      racism often emerges. The study also examines the extent to which the educators acknowledge,
      and are critical of, structures that impede the academic progress of students of color.
      Finally, it explores their perspectives on the role of white colleagues in anti-racist work in
      schools. Whereas other traditional research epistemologies, paradigms, and theories have
      explained the experiences of people of color in ways that have silenced and distorted their
      experiences with racism, these educators' racialized experiences are viewed as sources of
      resistance and strength. Consequently, in the tradition of Critical Race Theory, those
      experiences are presented as counter-narratives: narratives that speak against the dominant
      stories told about the impact and effects of racism. Those experiences also serve as the basis
      for a critical analysis of the daily functioning of schools that centers the role played by
      race. While the counternarratives reveal the diversity of microaggressions that influence the
      work and lives of these educators, the critical analysis exposes the ways in which racism and
      racist views are embedded into school structures, processes, and discourses. Working
      symbiotically, those structures, processes, and discourses serve as the instruments through
      which boundaries and barriers are created and maintained. Consequently, race-based inequities
      and exclusionary practices become institutionalize. Concluding with a call to action, the
      study suggests that if we desire to address the issues illuminated by the educators'
      experiences in concrete ways that result in tangible, material benefits for both educators and
      students of color, it will be the responsibility of those most directly positioned to bring
      about such change - school administrators and schools and colleges of education.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In an effort to better understand conduct problems among children and adolescents,
      considerable research has focused on the neuropsychological characteristics of youth with such
      problems. Language, one of several neuropsychological constructs, has been linked to conduct
      problems in youth. However, there remain many unanswered questions regarding this
      relationship. Therefore, this study seeks to quantitatively describe the association between
      conduct problems and language function using meta-analytic procedures. Analyses are guided by
      the following research questions: What is the magnitude of mean effect size for global
      language functioning in youth with conduct problems? Do studies evidence a relationship
      between conduct problems and more specific constructs of language function such as receptive
      and expressive language? How do certain variables (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, presence of
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and type of conduct problem) impact the relationship
      between conduct problems and language functioning? Relevant articles were identified by
      keyword searches of the Psych INFO database as well as by examining reference lists of
      collected articles. This process identified 235 contemporary research articles (i.e. conducted
      since 1980), which were reviewed for relevant information and subjected to inclusion criteria.
      Seventeen studies met the following criteria for inclusion: empirical studies conducted since
      1980, employing group contrast design with nondisordered controls to investigate language
      functioning in participants younger than 21-years of age, and utilizing standardized measures
      of language function. Three separate metaanalyses, one for each language construct,
      investigated the distribution of standardized mean difference effect size statistics (Hedges's
      g). Analysis also include d heterogeneity testing and moderator analysis. Results indicated
      significant effect sizes for global, receptive, and expressive language in the moderate to
      strong range. Findings also suggested that ethnicity moderates the relationship between
      language functioning and conduct problems, with minorities at greater risk than
      non-minorities. Overall, findings provided strong evidence for an underlying
      neuropsychological deficit in language functioning in many youth with conduct problems, with
      some demographic variables moderating the magnitude of these effects.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>My dissertation is a study of health care workers and clients in a private,
      not-for-profit health care center. Through participant observation and in-depth interviews I
      analyze how workers at a community clinic reproduce or respond to inequalities of race, class,
      and gender in their interactions with each other and in their daily work with poor clients,
      especially Latinas/os. As a symbolic interactionist and feminist ethnographer, I studied how
      health care providers came to act as they did as well as the consequences of their behavior
      for their clients, other staff, and themselves. I identify how inequality was reproduced,
      including the interactions, roles, identities, meanings, and emotions that were central to the
      people at the clinic. In Chapter 1, I explore how the Black female staff draw on racialized
      and gendered rhetorics to criticize and claim status over Latinas. These rhetorics followed
      from the discourses constructed and used by white elites to reinforce racism and sexism. Black
      women used these rhetorics as a way to respond to the changes in the racial make-up of clients
      and the accompanying hiring of bilingual staff, mostly Latinas. Similarly, Latinas used images
      of pushy, bossy, and "uppity Black women" against the Black staff. I argue
      that these strategies divided low-status workers. In Chapter 2, I examine how the Maternity
      Care Coordinators (MCCs) maintained a moral identity as good health care providers. The MCCs
      defined Latinas as the "neediest of the needy" and
      "Americans" as the privileged clients. They thought differently about the
      Latina, Black, and white women they served. In Chapter 3, I explore how the white high-status
      staff's solidarity-talk kept them from seeing the significance of race in interactions among
      staff members. The rhetoric used largely by the white high-status staff protected them from
      having to "see" their own race and did not help Latina and Black staff
      develop solidarity. Finally, in the conclusion I highlight how the staff might have come to
      recognize racism, sexism, and class inequality if organizational arrangements had been
      different.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study tracks magic as a recurring and ambivalent figure in early-twentiethcentury
      Cuban intellectual discourse. In the wake of Cuba's formal political independence in 1902,
      magic surfaced as a major practical concern. Public debates swirled around questions about the
      place of 'primitive' magical practices in Cuban society. In these collective discussions,
      African-inflected traditions in Cuba commonly stood as the embodiment of the primitive
      propensity to magic. The notion of "Afro-Cuban culture" emerged during the
      first years of independence and, in turn, the notion of "Afro-Cuban studies"
      as a field of social science also took shape. Thus, the title of the dissertation refers most
      immediately to the widespread call for the elimination, or displacement, of magic in general
      and of Afro-Cuban "witchcraft" [brujería] in particular as means to Cuba's
      realization as a truly independent and modern society. At the same time, magic also appeared
      in other ways in the public discussions on Cuba's future. To many Cubans, modernity seemed to
      depend upon its own form of magic, namely, a process of commodification that transformed
      everything and everyone into inanimate entities for capitalist exchange. Cuban intellectuals
      responded by searching for critical strategies that would displace not only the magical
      endeavors of primitives but also what one critic identified as "the magic power of
      money" in modern life. The intellectuals typically framed the critical effort to
      displace different forms of magic as magical in its own right. In examining this repeated
      ironic gesture, the dissertation focuses especially on intellectual activity in the years
      after the 1933 fall of Gerardo Machado's regime, a period of profound socio-political
      transition for Cubans. The study considers the intellectual production of the Afro-Cuban
      tradition "Santería" as an enduring and emblematic development of the times,
      when the island's most prominent public figures formally inaugurated Afro-Cuban studies as
      field of inquiry and as an alternate forum for political action. Fernando Ortiz stands at the
      center of these events. The dissertation closely considers his efforts to pioneer Afro-Cuban
      studies as well as engagements with Ortiz's work-both direct and indirect-by Alejo Carpentier,
      Nicolás Guillén, and Rómulo Lachatañeré.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>With the increasing trend to include children with disabilities in today's classrooms,
      educators need to be aware of the individual needs of these students both academically and
      socially. This study investigated the differences in social factors among third and fourth
      graders in a suburban school district. Students with disabilities (n = 128) were compared to
      their non-labeled peers (n = 1281) on the following variables: peer acceptance, victimization,
      bullying, reciprocal friendships, total self-concept, popularity self-concept, social
      selfefficacy, social outcome expectancy, and social anxiety. Children classified as having a
      disability included those with a Learning Disabled (LD), Other Health Impairment (OHI),
      Speech/Language Impairment (SLI), and Educable Mental Disability (EMD). Results demonstrated
      that when compared to their non-labeled peers, students with disabilities were more often
      nominated as "liked least," victimized, and bullying others and reported
      having fewer reciprocal friendships and a lower self-concept. Further analyses revealed that
      male students with disabilities were most likely to have low peer acceptance and be seen as
      bullies, especially those in minority groups. Among students with disabilities, boys with OHI
      were more often "liked least" and were viewed as bullies most often followed
      by students with LD. Students with LD were seen most often as victimized by their peers.
      Students with SLI reported having the most reciprocal friendships among all children studied
      and were seldom seen as bullies. Caucasian girls reported having the highest self-concept
      among students studied while boys in the minority reported the lowest self-concept scores.
      Female students in minority groups reported higher levels of social anxiety than their
      Caucasian peers. Among children classified as LD and OHI, being victimized and bullying others
      was found to significantly contribute to lower levels of peer acceptance. Among children with
      OHI, being victimized was found to contribute to a lower self-concept while bullying others
      was found to significantly contribute to a higher social self-efficacy. Implications for
      developing interventions to improve the socialization of children with disabilities are
      discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Suggesting that reputation and gossip have been largely ignored by contemporary
      political theorists, I argue that both reputation and the gossip that helps to constitute it
      are important aspects of our communal and political lives. I begin with the work of
      Jean-Jacques Rousseau as representative of a larger early modern discourse that identified the
      desire for reputation as one that is central to human beings. Arguing that this desire for
      reputation simultaneously poses great dangers and great power for political communities,
      Rousseau's vision urges careful attention to political arrangements as a way of harnessing the
      positive effects of the desire for reputation. In my second chapter, I move to a focus on the
      relationship between reputation and gender, interrogating the necessity that women maintain
      spotless sexual reputations (a central feature to Rousseau's political schema) in light of
      both Mary Wollstonecraft's critique of Rousseau as well as my examination of the fate of
      Rousseau's heroines. Turning to the work of Harriet Taylor and John Stuart Mill, I contend
      that their arguments about the stifling effects of reputational politics for individual
      liberty point to a nuanced understanding of the differential effects of reputation for
      individuals in various echelons of society. Chapter 4 takes up George Orwell's novel Burmese
      Days as well as his essay "Shooting an Elephant" to think about the ways in
      which reputation and gossip work in contexts of radical differences of power. While both of
      these works are situated in the colonial context, I argue that Orwell's observations about the
      functions of gossip and reputation within relationships of incommensurate power are
      instructive beyond the colonial setting. Finally, in Chapter 5, I turn to contemporary
      political events to explore the previous chapters' themes of community, gender, individual
      liberty, and power through the lens of sexual reputation and the gossip that surfaced during
      the Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky scandal.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Shrimp trawler discards account for 1.9 million mt of the 6.8 million mt of annual
      global fisheries discards. This study examined the effects of dead discards from the North
      Carolina estuarine shrimp trawl fishery on scavenger populations and examined the trophic
      changes resulting from fishery practices. Bycatch and discards onboard estuarine shrimp
      trawlers were quantified, identified, and monitored for short-term survival. The major taxa in
      the bycatch both by weight and number were juvenile finfish and portunid crabs. Crabs showed
      high survival while 78% of fish died, generating a substantial amount of carrion in the
      estuaries, most of which sinks. Scavenging for discards occurred mainly by blue crabs and
      pinfish in the lower meter of the water column. In laboratory experiments blue crabs fed on
      discards six times more than on a natural prey, the juvenile hard clam, and this was
      replicated in mesocosm experiments lasting three days, where predation on juvenile hard clams
      was 33-60% less in treatments where discards were added. Thus, the shrimp, blue crab, and
      bivalve fisheries in estuarine waters of North Carolina are interconnected. Early and late
      summer quantitative ecosystem mass-balance models were constructed for two years of varying
      intensity of disturbance from hypoxia with four fishing treatments within each of the four
      time periods modeled: no fishing or discarding, fishing extraction alone, discarding alone,
      and combined fishing extraction and discarding of carrion. The effects of fishing on trophic
      structure, carbon flow and system network properties as calculated by Ecopath software were
      minimal compared to differences due to season and disturbance by hypoxia. However, fishing and
      discarding changed the trophic level at which many consumers fed, decreased transfer
      efficiency of energy through and out of the system, and altered trophic interactions. Pathways
      for energy transfer increased when discards were present, increasing measures of system
      stability. More system production was retained as detritus when discards were included in
      models. Management must acknowledge the ecosystem impacts of fisheries, and ecosystem-based
      management will be more successful if eutrophication is minimized and if the suite of
      interactions between fisheries and fished species are considered in management plans.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation examines the evidence for foundation rituals in post-Bronze Age
      Greece while investigating their function and meaning in ancient Greek culture. Foundation
      rituals are prescribed rites known throughout the ancient Mediterranean that marked the
      initiation of a buildings' construction, usually with a combination of prayer, sacrifice, and
      the burial of foundation deposits containing offerings of various types and/or sacrificial
      material. These distinctive deposits were ritually interred during the beginning stages of
      construction, usually within the fabric of the structure itself. The discovery of foundation
      deposits in association with cult architecture from all over the ancient Greek world and from
      every historical period attests that foundation rituals were regular features of sacred
      building. This dissertation presents all published foundation deposits in their archaeological
      contexts and identifies patterns in placement, method of deposition, type of material
      deposited, and geographic distribution. Reconstructed from the archaeological evidence,
      ancient Greek foundation rituals are related to the broader history of foundation rituals in
      the ancient Mediterranean, especially to the traditions of Egypt and Mesopotamia. Of
      particular importance are the formal similarities Greek foundation deposits share with those
      of Near Eastern cultures, an affinity which appears especially intense in East Greece and
      other areas where contact with the Near East was strongest. This dissertation argues that
      Greek foundation rituals are Near Eastern in origin and were likely developed through contact
      with these cultures, further illustrating the impact of eastern traditions on Greek sacred
      architecture. The archaeological and historical context of Greek foundation deposits provides
      a foundation for the investigation of the meaning and function of foundation rituals in
      ancient Greek culture. One of the principal functions of Mediterranean foundation rituals was
      to forge the public perception of a socially advantageous link between patrons of buildings
      and the gods they honor. This dissertation maintains that Greek foundation rituals similarly
      underscored a close relationship between human patrons and divinities through the topos of
      building, in which the sanction and assistance of the gods were perceived to play major roles.
      This view is substantiated by the portrayal of building and builders in Greek myth, where the
      procurement and elaboration of sacred space frequently result from divine guidance or miracle,
      and not human industry. This study argues that foundation rituals describe a "culture
      of building" in ancient Greece, that is, they reveal ancient perceptions about
      building and builders by reflecting the cultic responses these perceptions elicited. In
      investigating these important rites, this dissertation offers new insight into the process of
      constructing sacred architecture and the role it played in Greek society.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Although schools have often served as agents of cultural assimilation, they have also
      been sites of contestation and transformative change. Despite an increasingly substantial body
      of literature that addresses the need for teacher transformation, particularly among white
      teachers, there has been little focus on the process and implications of concientization
      within specific settings. This dissertation chronicles a participatory, ethnographic study of
      the lived experience of one English Language Arts teacher dedicated to the more equitable
      transformation of self and school. Spanning interactions from 2003-2006, but concentrating
      primarily on her work as the only English teacher in a new program, it details her attempt to
      redefine practice in more critical and culturally relevant ways and explores the impact of
      such work on teacher identity. In particular, the emic tropes of the Good Teacher and the
      Better Student are explored as problematic identity constructions with crucial consequences
      for teacher-student relationships and pedagogical decisions. Sustained by stratified
      classrooms and defining achievement in limited ways, they oversimplify the complex set of
      interactions that necessarily comprise teaching and learning. This study offers a window on
      transformative practice in process-its inception, its challenges, and its ultimate impact on
      teacher identity. Specifically, it includes an examination of 1) a teacher's work in two
      separate school systems-a traditional, comprehensive, suburban high school serving a largely
      white population, and an alternative, urban Middle College program serving mostly students of
      color; 2) the power and problems arising from authentic care-oriented classroom relations, and
      3) the success and failure of reinvented pedagogical approaches. It argues that, in this case,
      transformation also creates an identity crisis that simultaneously empowers and destroys,
      undermining the teacher's sense of self, efficacy, and sustainability even as it inspires her
      to advocate for marginalized students and to hope for wider social change.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study examines the influence of external economies on the survival and longevity
      of new independent businesses in the continental U.S. It hypothesizes that new firms with
      access to the sources of specialized inputs, labor, product markets and knowledge spillovers
      will outlive those in areas of relative isolation. The size of the region and the diversity of
      its industrial base are also considered as possible sources of beneficial external economies.
      The findings show that while external economies have a statistically significant influence on
      new firm survival, the effects are typically very modest. The most consistently significant
      effects are found for localization, which lowers the risk of new firm failure in five of the
      nine detailed study industries examined: farm and garden machinery, metalworking machinery,
      motor vehicle parts, advertising and computer and data programming services. After controlling
      for other sources of external economies, the size of the region is insignificant for most
      industries. By contrast, regional industrial diversity reduces hazard rates for new firms in
      drugs, advertising, computer and data processing, and research and testing services. Measures
      representing the specific sources of localization are statistically significant in fewer
      industries than the broadly defined measures of localization, but when significant they often
      have a stronger influence on new firm longevity. Among the specific sources of localization,
      proximity to specialized input suppliers is the most consistently significant, reducing hazard
      rates for new firms in metalworking machinery, advertising, and computer and data processing
      services. Proximity to intermediate product markets is only significantly beneficial in the
      professional services sector. Labor pooling is either insignificant or found to increase new
      firm hazard rates, but only after the other sources of localization are controlled. Industry
      knowledge spillovers significantly reduce hazard rates for new firms in the drugs and motor
      vehicle parts industry, but the accuracy of the variable may be sensitive to industry-specific
      differences in the economic value of patenting. This study also investigates whether and how
      the size of the establishment influences new firms' ability to benefit from their external
      environment. The evidence suggests that smaller businesses are the most common beneficiaries
      of external economies, but not in all cases. There are several examples, most commonly for
      urbanization, where external economies increase the failure rates of larger plants while
      having little effect on smaller ones. There are also several industries where an increase in
      external economies produces a relative reduction in hazard rates for medium sized plants, but
      have little effect on smaller plants. Overall the research implies that entrepreneurial
      development strategies are likely to be more effective if designed to capitalize upon a
      region's existing strengths and assets. The beneficial influence of localization and diversity
      are often strongest when estimated at larger spatial scales, i.e. those approximating the size
      of commuting sheds and labor market areas. That provides some conditional support for rural
      development strategies aimed at strengthening ties to nearby metropolitan areas.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study investigates the multiple functions of the rhetorical device ekphrasis -
      the verbal representation of a visual representation - in Wirnt von Gravenberg's
      thirteenth-century verse romance Wigalois, one of the most popular and enduring Arthurian
      romances in the Middle High German literary tradition. The dissertation explores how the
      numerous ekphrastic descriptions provide narrative and thematic structure, harmonize potential
      conflicts in the text, and contribute to the construction of courtly identity. An examination
      of Wigalois manuscripts ranging from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries offers a new
      interpretation of Wigalois that takes into account the fluidity of the text in its material
      environment. The study thus elucidates the close connections between ekphrasis and medieval
      literary culture; demonstrates that the vibrant symbiosis of word and image is a crucial
      factor in explaining the poem's sustained popularity and unbroken line of transmission for
      more than six hundred years; and contributes to the history of the book and to the
      historicization of medieval and modern modes of perception.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Adolescence is a time of significant transition and major life changes. In particular,
      relationships between parents and adolescents are characterized by movement toward increasing
      adolescent autonomy and renegotiation of parental authority. The relationship between parents
      and adolescents has been found to be an important contributor to adolescent well-being.
      Research has linked parent-child relationship quality to a wide variety of adolescent
      outcomes, including areas such as academic achievement, delinquency and risk behaviors, mental
      health and well-being, and life satisfaction. Given the significant impact of the
      parent-adolescent relationship on adolescent outcomes, this study seeks to contribute to our
      understanding of the relationships between adolescents and their parents, with a particular
      focus on the intersection of religion and parent-child relationships. The goal of the first
      chapter is to identify different dimensions of religion and examine how they are related to
      the quality of relationships between adolescents and their parents. The following two chapters
      further specify these relationships, first through an examination of the mediating role of
      social resources in the link between religion and relationship quality, and second through
      sub-population analysis comparing the role of religion in the parent-child relationships of
      black and white adolescents. Taken together, the three chapters that comprise this
      dissertation lead us to a more comprehensive understanding of religion's role in teenagers'
      perceptions of their relationships with their parents. Evidence is provided to further our
      understanding of religion as a multidimensional social force in family life, to elucidate how
      religious involvement may confer social resources that improve family relations, and how these
      patterns may vary within particular cultural contexts. The findings presented here help us
      better understand the role of the institution of religion in family lives and suggest broader
      mechanisms of religious influence.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>It is universally acknowledged that the family is the basis of society, and that its
      traditional structure is patriarchal. In this dissertation I study theatrical representations
      of the modern Peruvian family as allegorical depictions of the sociopolitical situation of the
      country at the end of the twentieth and beginning of the twenty-first centuries. I focus my
      examination of broken families as an allegory of the instability in Peru through the analysis
      of seven plays by Limeño playwrights. Chapter One delineates the violent historical background
      of the years immediately preceding the time period on which I focus, followed by a detailed
      analysis of Los del "4" (1968), by Gregor Díaz. His depiction of a family
      torn apart by financial constraints and a lack of communication represents a precursor of the
      family allegories written in later years. Chapter Two examines two innovative plays that use
      television as a reflection of the realities of contemporary Peru. Con guitarra y sin cajón
      (2001) by Maritza Kirchhausen and Historietas (1999), by Paco Caparó, stress the need to focus
      on creating opportunities for Peruvian youth. Chapter Three looks at the impact that a
      father's abandonment has on his child as an allegory of the lack of effective political and
      social structure. Vladimir (1994), by Alfonso Santistevan and El día de la luna (1996), by
      Eduardo Adrianzén highlight the negative effect of this absence on the ability of young people
      to make positive life choices. My last chapter looks at two feminist plays, La madre (1997),
      by Sara Joffré and Lucía (2001), by Claudia Besaccia. These playwrights use the representation
      of private spaces to make their voices heard publicly. While Peruvian society tends to silence
      women by expecting their fulfillment of stereotypical roles, these plays demonstrate the
      necessity of allowing women to be heard in the political, social and family arenas. Limeño
      playwrights frequently allegorize the continuing instability in Peru through the dramatic
      staging of difficult familial situations. The effectiveness of this approach is due to the
      universality of the subject of family and its central role in the development of society.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study consists of a pair of papers which examine the relative effects of
      academic, social and financial characteristics on four-year college persistence and completion
      outcomes, conditional upon initial enrollment. I employ discrete time event history modeling
      to control for duration dependence in estimating the probability of stopping out before the
      completion of a bachelor's degree. In the first paper I test whether persistence and
      graduation rates for African-American students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities
      (HBCU) differ from those at Traditionally White Institutions (TWI). The results of my analysis
      reveal that overall, African-American students who attend HBCUs are no more likely than those
      who attend TWIs to experience an interruption in enrollment before the end of the fourth year
      or to return to the same university after a period of non-enrollment. However, during the
      1980s, HBCU students were more likely than those at TWIs to receive a bachelor's degree within
      six years. During the 1990s, there was no statistical difference in graduation rates between
      students attending HBCUs and those attending TWIs. In the second paper, I estimate the effects
      of the Pell grant, total grant aid, and total financial aid (including grants and loans) on
      college persistence behavior. I adopt estimation methods that take advantage of
      discontinuities in the Pell grant and EFC formulas in order to obtain unbiased estimates of
      the effect of financial aid on persistence behavior. The results suggest that a $1,000
      increase in the scheduled Pell grant reduces the probability of stopout for four-year college
      students by 0.5 to 0.8 percentage points. The total effect of grant aid, which included the
      Pell grant as well as other types of need-based and merit-based grant aid, was found to have
      no effect on stopout behavior among four-year college students. On the other hand, a $1,000
      increase in the total aid package, including grants, loans and workstudy, increased the
      likelihood of stopping out by 0.6 to 1.1 percentage points. In both papers, academic
      performance and family background were the greatest determinants of persistence and degree
      attainment.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Temporal processes affect a number of interpersonal phenomena. Four studies examine
      the role of time in impression management. Specifically, it is predicted that people use
      indirect self-presentation more and rate it as more effective in the distant future versus
      near future. The opposite pattern is predicted for direct self-presentation. Study 1
      demonstrates this effect using scenario methodology. Study 2 conceptually
      "reverses" the effect by manipulating impression management and measuring
      subjective temporal appraisal. Study 3 shows that minimal connections (in this case a shared
      birthday) are used more in the distant versus near future. Study 4 shows the predicted effect
      using a real time manipulation. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that time affects
      both the use and perceived effectiveness of impression management. Future research
      possibilities are discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Hydrodynamic Chromatography (HDC) was used as a purification method for packing
      materials (particles) in the micron to sub-micron range. Using HDC, the relative standard
      deviation for the size distribution of a batch of packing material was successfully narrowed
      from 33% to 16%. Subsequent chromatographic evaluation of this material, using capillary
      ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) showed significant improvement in performance
      and decrease in flow resistance over the unpurified material. The capillary time-of-flight
      (CTOF) instrument was envisioned and constructed. This instrument uses the poiseuille flow
      principle to measure solution viscosity at pressures up to 4000 bar. Another embodiment of
      this instrument enabled the simultaneous measurement of diffusion coefficient and the solution
      viscosity up to pressures of 2000 bar. Diffusion coefficient and viscosity data obtained from
      this instrument allowed for reevaluation of previously collected UHPLC data and provided
      significant new insight into column performance.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation analyzes the relationship between social history and the geographic
      spread of modernism. Many critics have noted the irony that writers from the South-the
      nation's poorest and most illiterate region in the first half of the twentieth
      century-cultivated an unexpected literary flowering between World War I and World War II. I
      argue that World War I acted as a pivotal catalytic event, ending the post- Reconstruction
      South's self-imposed intellectual isolation and allowing for the diffusion of modern American
      and European social, cultural, and economic practices into the region, thus shifting the
      region's economic base from agriculture to industry and moving the region's intellectual
      superstructure from regionalism to modernism. In five chapters I examine the representation of
      World War I in modernist texts by southern and non-southern writers. The first two chapters
      analyze changes in the demographic and economic foundation of southern culture, connecting the
      war as a vehicle for interregional cultural exchange to William Faulkner's Soldiers' Pay and
      short stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald and tracing the emergence of mechanization and
      industrialization in Ellen Glasgow's Barren Ground and Faulkner's Flags in the Dust. The three
      subsequent chapters examine the effects of infrastructural change on major elements of
      southern society, exploring the effects of war-time patriotism on sectional ideology in
      William Alexander Percy's Lanterns on the Levee and Donald Davidson's The Tall Men, analyzing
      the war's impact on the struggle for civil rights in Walter White's The Fire in the Flint and

               <mods:abstract>The current study examined how theoretically relevant yet unexplored aspects of
      adolescent coping responses were related to symptoms of depression. Specifically, the emotion
      regulatory function of coping behaviors as well as an adolescent's relative use of coping
      dimensions and trajectories of adolescent coping were examined in response to a peer-related
      stressor. The Adolescent Coping Process Interview (ACPI), a scenario-based video vignette
      measure designed to assess adolescents' unfolding emotional arousal and coping responses as
      well as a standard depression measure were administered to 84 adolescents (mean age = 14.8,
      43% males) from a predominantly rural school district. Results from the current study do not
      support the emotion regulatory function of coping behaviors in relation to depression.
      However, results do suggest that an adolescent's relative use of coping dimensions, possibly
      reflecting a more "ruminative" response pattern, are positively associated
      with depressive symptoms above and beyond demographic characteristics or single dimensions of
      coping. In addition, findings offer preliminary support for the importance of the timing of
      coping behaviors within the coping process. Findings are discussed within the broader
      framework of using the current approach to assess adolescent coping responses and their
      relation to psychopathology.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Modern condensed matter physics owes much of its success to Fermi liquid theory. In
      recent times, however, the study of strongly correlated particle systems is opening up all-new
      territory in many-body physics. A peculiar class of such systems, that of nodal fermions, is
      characterized by the quasiparticle density of states vanishing at the point-like Fermi surface
      and long-range inter-particle interactions surviving unscreened. In the first part, I discuss
      fermion pairing in one such system, 2D graphene. By solving the gap equation for the excitonic
      order parameter, I obtain values of critical interaction strength for a variety of power-law
      interactions and densities of states. Furthermore, these results are then used to compute the
      respective free energies and analyze possible phase transitions. In the second part, I discuss
      the effects of lattice disorder and impurities on the density of states in nodal fermion
      systems. These results and predictions will be of interest to a broad range of physical
      problems involving nodal fermions, and can be tested in a variety of experimental directions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In the 1920s, Germany witnessed a series of revivals of the operas of G.F. Handel,
      works which had almost entirely lapsed from the German musical consciousness in the nearly 200
      years since the composer's death. The reemergence of Handel opera can be traced back to one
      man, Oskar Hagen, an Art History professor at the University of Göttingen who staged the
      landmark performance of Rodelinda in 1920. This performance and those that followed it were an
      unanticipated success, suddenly launching the performance of Handel operas across the country,
      and eventually, the world. Hagen's adaptation techniques, however, have been harshly
      criticized by modern scholars as being clumsy, audacious, and "inauthentic."
      This thesis focuses on Hagen's methods of musical adaptation and how they relate to the
      aesthetics of 1920s Germany, as well as the reception of Hagen's efforts and their impact on
      the performance practice of Handel opera in the twentieth century.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Studies have shown that females are more likely to suffer non-contact anterior
      cruciate ligament injuries than males. The study consisted of eleven gymnastics, fifteen
      lacrosse, and twelve soccer athletes with no history of major lower extremity or anterior
      cruciate ligament injury one month prior to testing. Lower extremity kinematics, kinetics, and
      vertical ground reaction forces were collected from the dominant leg of each subject. Joint
      angles at initial ground contact for female gymnasts were significantly less than soccer
      athletes for knee and hip flexion. Gymnasts displayed significantly larger knee extension
      moments, hip flexion moments, anterior tibial shear forces, and vertical ground reaction
      forces. Female gymnastics athletes performed jump-landing and cutting maneuvers in such a way
      that may predispose them to anterior cruciate ligament injury. Our results suggest that
      further investigation is needed into differences in movement patterns and injury rates between
      female athletes to determine which athletes are at greater risk for injuring the anterior
      cruciate ligament.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Some early reviewers of Camere separate have compared Pier Vittorio Tondelli's final
      work to a novel of formation. After a brief overview of Tondelli's literary output and an
      exploration of the evolution of the Bildungsroman genre as proposed by Moretti, the thesis
      aims at comparing Camere separate to the conventions of some of the early examples of
      Bildungsroman. Structurally, the novel does not follow the chronological order typical of the
      Bildungsroman and finds its organizing principle in ambient music rather than literature.
      Thematically, the elements which in the novel of formation help the main character find his
      place in society (most notably, work and marriage) are here what sets him apart from the
      community, thus making Camere separate a progressive study in separation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This descriptive study uses social cognitive theory to explore factors contributing to
      efficacy of adult mentors of middle school students in a school-based academic mentoring
      program. Using structured interviews and survey measures, the study uncovered factors that
      mentors' perceive as increasing their self-efficacy. Findings suggest that many factors
      contribute to mentors' efficacy. Among these are mentor-youth relationship duration, formal
      training, and a network of support. Results support theoretical and empirical research claims
      put forward to enhance efficacy. This study also contributes to knowledge of relationship
      quality by documenting criteria that mentors use to judge the success of relationships.
      Relationship quality criteria include: 1) holistic integration of mentor into student's life,
      2) perceptions of growth, 3) perceived mentee investment, 4) closeness of the relationship,
      and 5) perceptions of mentee satisfaction. Results indicate the reciprocally deterministic
      nature of mentors, mentees, and environmental factors that influence mentoring relationships.
      Implications for future research and practice are offered.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to explore the tension between two dominant stereotypes
      of female victims of intimate partner violence: an innocent victim, or an assertive survivor.
      10 female and 10 male participants listened to one of two audio recordings of a woman's
      experience with intimate partner violence and participated in an interview regarding what they
      heard. The participants in this study were quite aware of the dominant stereotypes and
      suggested that women who have been targets of intimate partner violence should not be too much
      of either. Also, their understandings of intimate partner violence often supported common
      myths about intimate partner violence. Ultimately, this study has suggested that women who are
      victims of violence are often constrained by narrow definitions of acceptable feminine
      behavior and that deviations from those norms has serious consequences for female victims of
      violence.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Tamarins (Saguinus) are a diverse genus of Amazonian primates with distributions that
      often coincide with rivers. This distributional pattern might be explained by the riverine
      barrier hypothesis, which suggests that rivers reduce gene flow by limiting dispersal. I
      investigated the differences in vocalizations among populations of Saguinus separated by
      rivers of different widths. I recorded alarm calls and long calls of four populations of
      Saguinus in three river compartments of northeastern Peru. ANOVAs and hierarchical clustering
      of call parameters showed that differences between populations did not reflect patterns
      expected by the riverine barrier hypothesis. Instead, differences among long calls reflected a
      recent phylogeny. Alarm calls diverged in sympatric populations, contrary to patterns of
      convergent evolution of alarm calls in other coexisting animals. Perhaps alarm calls are more
      important for the coordination of conspecific groups than previously thought.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This research addresses the construction of personae on reality television series.
      Given Richard Dyer's formulation of stardom as a balance of ordinary and extraordinary
      qualities, this paper seeks to understand how a reality television participant, lacking any
      traditional performance talent, could be articulated as extraordinary. Kenneth Burke's concept
      of "mystery" as a desirability attached to objects atop a social hierarchy
      is used to help explicate the qualities of extraordinariness in reality TV stardom.
      Comparative formal analyses of three reality "star texts" delineate the
      differences between two women who attain limited fame and one who achieves wider stardom. It
      is concluded that two qualities are necessary to transcending the usual limits of reality
      television fame: the articulation of social power (closely tied to class); and the appearance
      of freedom and agency, even when under the constant surveillance of producers and camera
      operators.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper attempts to determine whether citizens that "drive"
      changes in public opinion share certain demographic characteristics. Extant theory informs us
      that these citizens should be attentive to media signals (sophisticated) and unattached to
      either side of the ideological spectrum (moderate). Conversely, unsophisticated ideologues
      should be unresponsive because they do not pay attention to media signals and are attached to
      an ideology that mitigates their response. I analyze three time series from the General Social
      Survey. In each, I find parallel opinion movement from sophisticated moderates and
      unsophisticated ideologues. Using regression analysis, I find that sophisticated moderates
      contribute significantly more to changes in executive confidence, unsophisticated ideologues
      contribute significantly more to changes in welfare spending preferences, and both strata
      contribute equally to changes in defense spending preferences. I conclude that the extant
      theory is not supported empirically; there is no evidence that sophisticated moderates
      consistently "drive" changes in public opinion.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine how foot type and a foot orthotic device
      (FOD) affect electromyography (EMG) and kinetic data (COP). Thirty-nine individuals (20 with
      normal and 19 with pronated feet) were tested in overground walking in a pretestposttest
      design. Results of statistical analyses show no significant differences with regards to onset
      and duration of the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, vastus medialis (VMO), and gluteus
      medius muscles. These results suggest there is no difference in onset and duration, between
      normal and pronated feet. There was a trend specifically with VMO duration, suggesting a
      possible shorter duration time with FOD intervention. The COP examination indicated that the
      normal group had significantly greater COP excursion during the first 50% of stance phase.
      Also, a similar trend in greater normal foot COP excursion existed between the groups for the
      entire stance phase.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>America is becoming increasingly wasteful with its food, as almost half of the
      products grown or produced in America are not eaten. This waste of resources costs farmers,
      food companies, individuals and the U.S. government more than $100 billion each year. The
      majority of these losses could be avoided, possibly helping feed hungry citizens and reduce
      the American trade deficit. The purpose of this study is to illuminate the phenomenon of food
      waste, examining how and why America squanders so much edible food. To do so, this series of
      three journalistic articles will investigate food waste in farm, retail and household
      settings.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The relationship Between Humeral Rotation and Scapular Tipping. (Under the direction
      of Darin A. Padua, PhD, ATC) Background: Decreased shoulder range of motion as well as
      aberrant scapular mechanics are suggested as risk factors for shoulder pain. Minimal data
      describing scapular motion during humeral rotation exists even though it is evaluated
      clinically. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between humeral
      rotation and scapular tipping. Twenty-five participants were studied. A universal goniometer
      was used to assess shoulder range of motion. Three-dimensional motion tracking was used to
      assess scapular kinematics. Statistically significant negative relationships were found
      between shoulder internal rotation ROM and scapular tipping at maximum humeral IR range during
      passive rotation task (r = -0.418, p = 0.033), as well as, scapular tipping ROM at 90? of
      humeral flexion angle (r = -0.367, p = 0.055) during a functional diagonal task. The total arc
      of shoulder rotation ROM was also negatively related to both scapular tipping ROM at 90? of
      humeral flexion angle (r = -0.397, p = 0.041) and scapular tipping ROM at maximal humeral
      flexion angle during functional diagonal task (r = -0.477, p = 0.017). The posterior shoulder
      flexibility measure was positively related to scapular tipping ROM at 90? of humeral flexion
      angle (r = 0.414, p = 0.035) and scapular tipping ROM at maximal humeral flexion angle during
      functional diagonal task (r = .384, p = 0.048). This study is the first to assess the
      relationship between clinical measures of shoulder ROM and scapular tipping ROM during
      functional tasks. Decreased shoulder ROM was related to increased scapular tipping ROM. Both
      decreased shoulder ROM and increased scapular tipping during shoulder rotation has been
      associated with shoulder pain.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a theoretical concussive
      injury threshold on balance and neurocognitive performance in the absence of self-reported
      symptoms immediately following two different impact conditions (high and low) sustained in 43
      Division I football players. A double-blind study utilized the Head Impact Telemetry System to
      classify subjects into the two testing conditions. Data were collected during the 2005
      football season and 2006 spring season. Balance performance, neuropsychological functioning
      and self-reported symptoms were all assessed and separate repeated measures ANCOVA's were
      performed for each. Our data analyses resulted in significant differences for only a few of
      the comparisons made between the low and high magnitude conditions compared to baseline.
      Overall, our findings suggest that sustaining an impact greater than 100g does not result in
      acute observable balance and neurocognitive deficits.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>A combined flume and field study examined the interactions between structure,
      hydrology and ecology at various spatial and temporal scales. Leaf litter was loosely applied
      as a metric for energy of a stream food web to examine controls on retention and transport in
      response to changing hydraulic regime. Questions examined included (1.) what are the small
      scale mechanisms of leaf retention; (2) do these mechanisms scale up to the reach scale? (3)
      how does channel morphology and structural diversity affect leaf litter retention? (4) as
      hydrology alters, do hydrology and physical structures switch in the hierarchy of drivers
      controlling stream metabolism? At low flood frequencies, hydrology was the main driver of leaf
      storage. At high frequencies, channel structure was most important. Channel complexity made
      the system less sensitive to increased flooding. Turbulence and rate of change in discharge
      were important drivers in leaf mobilization.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis explores the Internet Service Providers' immunity from cyber-torts by
      third parties since the enactment of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. It examines two
      court groups' rationales concerning Section 230's immunity provision: rationales split between
      those courts following the Fourth Circuit decision in Zeran v. AOL - which granted ISPs
      absolute immunity from torts liability - and other courts disagreeing with Zeran. The
      legislative history analyzed in this thesis strongly supports the premise that Section 230 did
      not grant perfect immunity, but instead limited immunity to ISPs that engaged in Good
      Samaritan blocking. Interest groups have strongly influenced the ISP immunity issue from the
      legislation to recent court cases. The case analysis demonstrates that broad immunity did not
      encourage ISPs to self-police the Internet. The news portal analysis demonstrates that
      anti-Zeran courts' reasoning concerning the meaning of the "development" of
      content is appropriate for applying to the current Internet environment.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Coevolutionary arms races in host-parasite systems drive the evolution of the host
      and/or the parasite in different directions depending on what level we investigate the
      interactions of hosts and parasites. Here, I focused on how parasite-mediated sexual selection
      may play a role in the maintenance of sexual dichromatism in an anuran-monogenean system. I
      also investigated whether variation in the host phenotype affects parasite virulence. My
      findings suggest that color may play an important role in mate choice. Color may function as a
      redundant indicator of potential mate quality. However, I found evidence that the host
      environment does not affect parasite growth because low virulence may be favored in this
      system to increase the chances of transmission regardless of host phenotype.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis focuses on anti-corporate globalization struggles within the United
      States, and how 911 became a trope around which these activist discourses had to function. Due
      to specific constructions and interpretations of this event, the United States saw a limiting
      of protest space, increased measures of security, and an increase in concern around issues of
      war, surveillance and the national. The nature of this shift disrupted immanent practices of
      resistance that sought to create alternative social and political configurations within the
      spatial-temporal existence of anti-corporate demonstrations. This ultimately served to
      foreclose certain means of resistance such as carnivalesque production of symbolic/utopian
      spaces, and networked production of an alternative common. Given the national-militaristic
      dominant discourse post-911, activists were interpellated into a defensive position. In
      responding to crises rather than promoting alternatives, activists' methods were necessarily
      altered.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Russian khotʹ is a colloquial particle whose exact function is difficult to determine.
      khotʹ can be translated as 'at least', 'even', 'although', 'for example', 'as much as' and
      others, depending on the context. The particle demonstrates unusual semantic and syntactic
      properties that conventional approaches are unable to fully explain. Viewing khotʹ as having a
      symbolic role that combines its syntactic and semantic features allows a more unified picture.
      The particle identifies a situation as marginal to a construed prototype in a speaker's mental
      space. This role operates within four general contexts: An axiological context, a context of
      knowledge and perception, a context of logical possibility, and an exemplary context. This
      symbolic role gives a unified meaning of the particle - an indicator of a marginal situation
      with respect to a construed norm. It is this symbolic approach that gives the most insight
      into a speaker's use of the word.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a structured therapeutic
      recreation program on selected psychological constructs for African Americans that have had a
      stroke. Using Bandura's social cognitive theory as a theoretical framework, the study utilized
      a mixed methods approach by establishing quantitative benchmarks for perceived self-efficacy,
      life satisfaction, and leisure attitude, followed by in-depth interviews to explore
      perceptions of study participants. Thirteen stroke survivors with a mean age of 55
      participated in the study. The three themes that emerged during qualitative data analysis were
      leisure participation, social support, and coping/acceptance. The themes and concepts that
      emerged contributed to the development of a "common experience through group
      leisure" model that provided a visual representation of the means through which
      participants received benefits in the program. Practical and theoretical implications and
      recommendations include examination of treatment in a group setting and outcome expectancy in
      therapeutic recreation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Though Mormon scholars have pursued Mormon studies since the 1960s, only in the first
      years of the twenty-first century did a few non-Mormon schools begin to institutionalize the
      study of Mormonism. Bringing Mormon studies into the academic mainstream has required
      negotiation among various interests. The most influential Mormon players in these negotiations
      promote "faithful scholarship," scholarship predicated on orthodox Mormon
      presuppositions. Efforts to mainstream faithful scholarship offer a case study for examining
      issues currently debated in religious studies, especially around the question of how much
      academic authority insiders' discourse about their religions ought to have. First, I narrate
      the development of scholarship on Mormonism from 1959 to 2006, focusing on the contests within
      Mormonism that led to faithful scholarship's becoming the dominant model for Mormon scholars.
      Then I analyze the means and consequences of faithful scholarship's influence on ongoing
      initiatives to institutionalize Mormon studies at non-Mormon academic institutions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with 20 college undergraduate women who
      talked about a past experience of being bullied by another girl(s) demonstrate how adolescent
      girl bullying may serve to reinforce norms of femininity and race. Participants reported one
      overarching theme of the importance of being "just enough. " This primary
      theme was elaborated by sub-themes of appearance, sexual development, and intelligence. Though
      many of the black and white women who were interviewed reported bullying as enforcing similar
      norms, a second theme specific to the black respondents emerged. This theme had to do with the
      importance of responding directly and usually verbally to their attackers. This study
      highlights the importance of beginning to understand the ways in which adolescent girl
      bullying may enact disciplinary power regarding gender and race norms.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>There are three negative particles used for sentential negation in Hindi-Urdu - mat,
      na, and nahII. The particles mat and na are generally of restricted distribution in the modern
      language, and their origins are relatively straightforward. The status of the modern general
      negative particle nahII is more problematic. There are two common explanations for modern
      Hindi-Urdu nahII: 1) nahII results from the Old Indo-Aryan (OIA) general negative particle na
      combining with a substantive/existential verb form; 2) nahII results from na combining with
      the OIA emphatic particle hi. In a recent account Elena Bashir offers support for both
      explanations. Based on evidence from a modern Hindi corpus and a reexamination of Bashir's
      work, I conclude that modern Hindi-Urdu nahII likely has its origin only in the existential,
      thus providing another example in support of William Croft's negation cycle.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper is an examination into the district factors and representative
      characteristics that lead to challenges of incumbent House members in party primaries. Given
      the extreme difficulty in defeating incumbent House members, it is expected that rational
      political actors will gauge the political climate carefully. Partisan dominated districts will
      be more likely to be the site of inter-party battles as the seats will be of greater value to
      potential challengers. Members that moderate their views will be more likely to be challenged
      due to the relative ideological extremity of the respective partisan base.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis examines the literary associations that, through allusion, Brazilian
      singer/songwriter Caetano Veloso brings to bear upon his work and suggests interpretations of
      the meanings sparked by these meetings of different texts. By reading seven allusive lyrics in
      Veloso's songbook, I intend to show that the songwriter's use of such allusions is a key
      aspect of his aesthetic and a mark of his broadening of the poetic dimensions of popular song.
      My aim is not to trace every allusion that Veloso makes, but rather to provide a framework for
      interpreting what his art of allusion generally entails. Furthermore, I underscore those
      aspects of Veloso's allusions that reflect the songwriter's dynamic reworking of literary
      material, rather than tracing the passive assimilation of "influences." That
      is, I analyze the way in which Veloso both invokes past writers and creates works that
      underscore their own creative difference from previous texts.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The Internet is quickly becoming a very important and unique source for leisure that
      is different from other traditional leisure activities. This investigation utilized a Web
      survey of 610 college students to explore the relationship between demographics, Internet
      experience, leisure-time Internet behaviors and attitudes, and social capital. Chi-square,
      somers’d, and canonical correlation analyses revealed an association between online leisure
      activities and social capital. Young adults who were experienced Internet users considered
      social interactions to be an important function of Internet leisure activities. Individuals
      who felt socially disconnected, had low social assurance, and depend more upon others, used
      online leisure activities to build their social networks and generate social capital. This
      research suggests that leisure-time Internet activities affect individuals’ social
      relationships and result in the development of online social capital.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis addresses how gangs (both organized and informal) at times provide more
      for lower-class youths than the state and/or contemporary family unit in Brazil and Colombia.
      I focus primarily on two novels-Arturo Alape's Sangre ajena and Patricia Melo's Inferno-which
      deal with domestic violence, the absence of worthy biological fathers, and the perpetually
      reinforced stereotype that a life of crime will yield familial, economic, and social rewards.
      I also use two films-Victor Gaviria's La Vendedora de rosas and Hector Babenco's Pixote-in
      order to demonstrate how street kinships can provide previously absent family units as well as
      a means to daily survival. This thesis incorporates sociological studies of Brazilian and
      Colombian lower-class youths involved in crime; I use this research as a point with which to
      compare the depiction of gangs and street children in the said novels and films.</mods:abstract>

      character who appears in both of their works. In The Picture of Dorian Gray, he is Lord Henry
      Wotton. In Senilità, he is Emilio Brentani. These characters represent what the Italian critic
      Giacomo Debenedetti saw as the domination of inner life over action. Because of this
      imbalance, these characters through psychological and creative manipulation convince others to
      become actors in their own dramas. Additionally, this study seeks to account for Debenedetti's
      anxiety over reading Svevo by suggesting that the critic feared these characters because they
      are able through imaginative means to alter the world with impunity.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This comparative analysis focuses on Mikhail Bulgakov's Heart of a Dog (1925) and
      Vladimir Mayakovsky's The Bedbug (1929). After providing a brief historical and literary
      context for these two ideologically opposed authors, this thesis explores both works'
      representations of the 1920s intelligentsia specialist and his role as a behavioral model and
      catalyst in the revolutionary evolution of the mythic new Soviet man. Additionally, the fate
      of Bulgakov's newly constructed Soviet proletarian specimen Comrade Sharikov is considered in
      reference to that of the defrosted 1929 Prisypkin in Mayakovsky's vision of the scientifically
      regulated Soviet utopia of the future. Ultimately, this thesis aims to explain the
      surprisingly similar tone of ambivalent acceptance of the New Economic Policy (NEP) status quo
      that emerges in both of these works within the framework of Bulgakov's unaltered
      prerevolutionary perspective and Mayakovsky's growing disillusionment with the course of the
      Soviet state.</mods:abstract>

      to find methods for teaching these texts that will make them accessible to today's students.
      Applying Nancy K. Miller's poetics for feminist writing to male-authored works is one way to
      bring these texts to today's woman reader. This essay illustrates how women readers can apply
      this method in order to create positive feminist readings of novels written by men. This essay
      provides an example of how Miller's poetics can be applied to the male-authored text, by
      employing them to two naturalist novels, Émile Zola's Nana and Theodore Dreiser's Sister
      Carrie.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Madison County Project explores the intertwined traditions of ballad singing and
      documentary work in Madison County, North Carolina. These dual traditions were investigated
      through interviews and ethnographic fieldwork with multiple generations of singers,
      filmmakers, photographers, and members of the cultural community. A focus is placed on the
      youngest generation of ballad singers, and how their modern lives interact with their
      traditional art form. This project culminates in a triad of research products including this
      text, a documentary film, and a multimedia website. These three-taken independently and
      working in tandem-allow for broad conversations around key cultural and social issues,
      encourage widely diverse audiences in such conversations, and provide a theatre in which to
      explore collaborative ethnography.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis explores how diplomatic relations between the US and the USSR changed
      during détente, specifically concentrating on the period between the 1972 Moscow Summit and
      the enactment of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the 1974 Trade Bill. I employ transcripts of
      diplomatic negotiations to investigate the ways that Soviet and American leaders used new
      personal relationships with their adversaries to achieve their foreign policy goals. In order
      to gain further understanding of the Soviet leadership's attitudes toward détente, I also
      examine how the Soviet government, through Pravda, communicated this new, increasingly complex
      diplomatic relationship to the Soviet public in a nuanced fashion, with multilayered
      presentations of American foreign policy that included portrayals of individual actors and not
      simply impersonal groups.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Through an examination of two Creole passing subject from literary passing narratives
      of the twentieth century, this thesis simultaneously treats two problems that have been
      largely overlooked by contemporary scholarship: the role of the Creole racial identity in the
      genre of the passing narrative, as well as the possibility of racial passing within the
      context of a Creole society. In Walter White's 1926 novel, Flight, and Mayotte Capécia's 1950
      novel, La négresse blanche, the protagonists' difficulties in negotiating a stable racial
      identity reveal the inherent weakness of the racial binary that is essential to the very
      notion of racial passing, and they also show that Creoleness has failed to establish itself as
      a stable racial identity in the societies represented in both novels.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The issue of dimensionality is essential to social science research but few
      researchers have empirically tested the dimensionality of theoretical constructs. One main
      reason is the uncertainty of how best to proceed. With the development of structural equation
      modeling with latent variables, several tests are available for researchers to choose. In this
      study, drawing on statistical theory and prior researches, I empirically assess the
      performance of likelihood ration test, confidence interval test, and vanishing tetrads test
      using data generated from Monte Carlo simulations. The study results show the likelihood ratio
      test did reasonably well. It does not show obvious signs of impact of the violation of
      boundary condition when testing for dimensionality. While overall the confidence interval test
      method appears to be too conservative, the vanishing tetrads tests for dimensionality works
      best for models with few indicators, but less well in larger models and smaller sample sizes.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study examined the role of Girl Scout volunteering for women. I used three
      guiding questions: 1) why women engaged in volunteering, 2) whether they considered it
      leisure, and 3) how they negotiated constraints to volunteering. Research was conducted
      through interviews with 12 long-term Girl Scout volunteers. Phenomenology provided the
      theoretical standpoint for the analysis, and constant comparison of the data resulted in
      several themes. All participants had daughters in their troops, and connected their
      volunteering to the responsibility to care for their daughter. Participants benefited from
      volunteering, which motivated them to continue. Most participants adopted a role identity as
      Girl Scout volunteers. Participants experienced volunteering as serious leisure, with all of
      the advantages and disadvantages inherent in commitment to complex pursuits.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Covariation between internalizing and externalizing problems is typically summarized
      using correlations. This assumes the same covariation pattern holds for all children, but
      there are empirical and theoretical rationales for qualitatively different patterns over time.
      In this study, growth mixture modeling of 8 waves of mother-reported internalizing and
      externalizing symptoms (ages 2-11; N=1,222) from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care were used
      to test four theories of internalizing/externalizing covariation. Growth mixture modeling
      probabilistically links developmental courses of internalizing and externalizing symptoms,
      while capturing heterogeneity in the expression of each. Results showed that stable
      covariation occurred at all levels of behavior (high, moderate, and low), for all functional
      forms of behavior (decreasing, persisting, or low-stable), and for the majority of children.
      Unique patterns of differentiation with development (among one fifth of boys) and rising
      internalizing (among one fifth of girls) evidenced in this study would have been obscured
      using correlational analyses.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The Lick Ridge eclogite is mapped as large bodies surrounded by accretionary wedge
      sediments in the Eastern Blue Ridge. The exhumation process of the Lick Ridge eclogite cannot
      be determined by analogy to other eclogite localities. Elsewhere, large bodies of eclogite are
      typically enclosed in continental rocks. Eclogite contained within accretionary wedge
      sediments do not exceed 25 meters in size. The orientation of the eclogite facies fabric can
      provide insight into the exhumation process. Two eclogite lineation directions are present,
      but one is dominant. Compositional and petrographic data show the two lineations were found
      contemporaneous and most likely reflect a strain heterogeneity during eclogite facies
      deformation. The pervasive lineation indicates that the different Lick Ridge eclogite blocks
      were exhumed within a coherent terrane rather than as large blocks within a flowing mélange.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In 2003, the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC) was unable to completely
      cover its scholarship budget through traditional means, due in part to a rise in tuition rates
      (Chapel Hill News, 2003). The pattern of elaborate athletic-related spending among competitor
      universities forced UNC to explore additional revenue streams that could potentially bolster
      their financial status, with specific attention towards the prospect of commercial signage
      within Kenan Stadium and the Dean E. Smith Center for the first time (Dick Baddour, personal
      communication, March 10, 2004). The study examined the recall and recognition ability of UNC
      students with respect to commercial sponsors of UNC men's basketball games. The findings
      showed a significant difference between upperclassmen and graduate students on the basis of
      sponsor recognition ability, however no difference in recognition between genders and a weak
      relationship between recognition ability and games attended.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis explores the history, vitality, and theology of liturgical music at a
      predominantly black Catholic parish in Durham, North Carolina. The introductory chapter
      explores the relationship of the methods used, diagnoses problems in the subject matter, and
      critiques approaches taken by others. The second chapter examines the history of music at Holy
      Cross. Chapter III explores the current musical practices at Holy Cross using traditional
      ethnographic methods. The final chapter reveals how theology can enter into fruitful dialogue
      with musicology. This dialogue may lead to original interpretations of musical life performed
      in the context of faith. At Holy Cross, music does not simply reflect the theology of black
      Catholics articulated by professional scholars; the theological content of music sung there
      does not reside solely in the musical and verbal texts. Instead, the parishioners set into
      motion an authentically Catholic praxis that rejects materialism while embracing the beauty of
      living.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>While ambiguity's ultimate role is to create "infinis Essais" in the
      minds of Montaigne's readers, gender, sexuality and friendship play decisive roles in the
      significance of this ambiguity. Montaigne's oscillation between misogyny and feminism is
      manifested in the female voice and female persona that the essayist establishes for himself.
      His exploration of friendship with men and women offers the reader a plethora of
      contradictions, problematizations, destabilization and uncertainty; "De
      l'amitié" is at the same time an hommage to and mourning for Etienne de La Boétie.
      Montaigne makes his readers consider love between men in ways they most certainly had not
      before. He recreates the ancients' debate about love between men, thus continuing their
      contemplation of homosexuality to an infinity that is atemporal. Montaigne's friendship with
      Marie de Gournay enables her to multiply the meaning of his Essais with a feminist objective,
      thereby problematizing the misogynistic passages in Montaigne's Essais.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Developmental test score scales have attracted more interest with recent legislation
      on educational measurement, yet there remain a surprising number of unanswered methodological
      questions about score scales. This research examined the effects of the number and difficulty
      level of linking items, the inclusion of noncommon items, the size of the mean difference
      between groups, and the sample size in accurately linking a score scale across groups. Data
      were simulated for binary items based on parameters from the 1998 National Assessment of
      Educational Progress Reading Assessment. Item response theory concurrent linking was used for
      1,000 replications each under more than 100 conditions. These results were evaluated in terms
      of bias and random variance of the recovered group mean differences and standard deviations.
      The results indicated that linking is generally reliable, regardless of other factors, when
      group means are 2 standard deviations apart or less.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This work examines the causes of corruption in eighteen Latin American countries from
      1994 to 2005. With Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index as the dependent
      variable, this study utilizes a pooled cross-sectional times series design to link corruption
      levels with a number of explanatory variables. There is evidence that economic development,
      inequality, trade, structural reforms index, democracy, federal structure, and
      ethno-linguistic fractionalization have significant effects on corruption. However, resource
      exports, age of democracy, and public sector size do not appear to affect corruption levels.
      This investigation draws on previous research on corruption but differs through having an
      exclusively Latin American focus and through its use of a time series design.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Previous analyses of the solicitor general's influence on the Supreme Court emphasize
      one of three explanations: expertise, an independent agent, or an ideological signal. Overall,
      the solicitor general is widely considered to serve two masters, both the President and Court.
      This creates an inherent tension between duties as a political advocate and independent legal
      agent. I propose a theory attempting to explain the interaction between these two roles. I
      argue that the political advocacy of the solicitor general has a direct impact on this
      independent status and success. I test my assertion using time series data from 1953-1985 and
      an individual-level analysis spanning the 1953-1993 Court terms. My results show a
      relationship between politicization and solicitor general success conditioned by the party
      supported in amici, the historical time period under investigation, and political issue
      salience. The data suggest a solicitor general-Court relationship dependent on the context
      surrounding litigation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis used content analysis to determine if four North Carolina newspapers and
      three national newspapers changed the content of the front pages of their sports pages between
      1995 and 2005 to compete with challenges coming from cable television and the Internet. If
      recaps of the day's events are available instantaneously on cable television and the Internet,
      newspapers may adjust their niche by relying more on feature/analysis stores, local stories,
      local writers and more visual aids. The research found that newspapers are not changing their
      niche in response to emerging media. Only one newspaper made statistically significant changes
      in publishing more feature/analysis stories and fewer recap stories in the time span. Only one
      newspaper made statistically significant changes in the location of stories it published. No
      newspapers made statistically significant changes in the type of authors they published, but
      most increased their use of either photos or graphics.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Cochlear implants are able to provide functional hearing to many deaf individuals
      through electrical stimulation of surviving nerves in the cochlea. While the general success
      of cochlear implants is well documented, there still remain many basic questions concerning an
      implant's interaction with the cochlear tissue. This research aims to explore the question of
      how electrical energy delivered by the implant as current pulses distributes through the
      tissue of the cochlea to generate extracellular potentials in the vicinity of surviving
      neurons. In particular, this work seeks to gain insight into how capacitive tissue properties
      effect the distribution of energy delivered by short-duration current pulses. This thesis
      describes a custom-build tissue chamber designed to maintain live cochlear tissue slices, as
      well as the hardware and software for implementing data collection and analysis protocols for
      characterizing potential distributions in the tissue slice during stimulation. Electrical
      stimulation is delivered via spatially-fixed ball electrodes, while a moveable metal
      microelectrode recorded data over a wide frequency range (30 Hz. to 100 kHz.) at 100 separate
      points evenly distributed across and within the tissue slice. To date the system has been
      tested with tissue substitutes such as bologna and potato slices to verify the function of the
      system. Continued work with cochlear slices will one day provide results that may improve the
      effectiveness of cochlear implants.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Introduction: Adolescent bullying has become increasingly recognized as a public
      health concern. Adolescents involved in bullying, as perpetrator or victim, have been shown to
      experience poorer physical and psychosocial health than those who are not involved.
      Adolescents who bully others are also more likely than those who do not to engage in more
      serious delinquent behaviors later. Most research on the topic has focused on the psychosocial
      characteristics of perpetrators and victims. Few studies have examined factors that contribute
      to the development of such behavior. With this study, I sought to apply the framework of
      Primary Socialization Theory (PST) to examine family, peer and school influences on the
      development of adolescent bullying behavior. Methods: Panel study data on 3,583 6th and 7th
      graders from 13 schools in 3 counties in North Carolina were used to examine the relationships
      between family, peer and school variables and adolescent bullying. Baseline data were
      collected in the Spring of 2002, and outcome data were collected one year later. Logistic
      regression models were used to test both mediational and moderation hypotheses regarding the
      relationships between social factors identified by PST. Additionally, multinomial logistic
      regression was used to examine the relationship between gender and type of bullying behaviors,
      as mediated by family bonds and normative environment. Results: Bullying prevalence was
      estimated at 58%. Family, peer and school normative environments were statistically
      significant predictors of bullying initiation; however strength of bonds to each of these
      three were not, nor did strength of bonds moderate the relationships between any of the three
      respective normative environments and bullying, as hypothesized. Age, ethnicity, gender and
      parental education were not significantly associated with onset of bullying. Gender was also
      not found to be a significant predictor of type of bullying. Conclusions: This study provided
      no evidence in support of the relationships proposed by PST. Results suggest that further
      refinement and testing of this relatively new theory is in order. Additionally, more research
      into the underlying factors that contribute to the development of bullying behaviors is needed
      in order to identify potential strategies for the prevention of this behavior and its
      consequences.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The relationship between alcohol consumption and three cardiovascular diseases
      (ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and heart failure) was examined in a population sample
      of middle-aged U.S. adults who were participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
      (ARIC) cohort. Alcohol intake was selfreported at two time periods. Stroke events were
      ascertained by contacting study participants and reviewing hospitalization and death
      certificate data. Heart failure (HF) events were identified from hospital discharge diagnoses
      and death certificates. To assess the association between alcohol consumption and each
      cardiovascular disease outcome separately, age-adjusted incidence rates by level of alcohol
      intake were calculated. Alcohol intake was categorized based on American Heart Association
      guidelines. Poisson regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (RRs) comparing
      levels of alcohol intake with never drinkers. Results were stratified by race. The crude RRs
      for all stroke showed an inverse association for occasional drinkers (RR=0.57,
      95%CI:0.42-0.77) and light/moderate drinkers (RR=0.74, 95%CI:0.59-0.94) as compared with never
      drinkers. After adjustment for age, race, sex, and socioeconomic status the RRs were
      attenuated (comparing occasional with never drinkers RR=0.91, 95%CI:0.67-1.25 and
      light/moderate with never drinkers iv (RR=0.99, 95%CI:0.77-1.28). Results for ischemic stroke
      were similar to those for all stroke. The crude RRs for hemorrhagic stroke were 1.16
      (95%CI:0.51-2.63) for former drinkers, 1.13 (95%CI:0.48-2.69) for occasional drinkers, 0.74
      (95%CI:0.32- 1.71) for light/moderate drinkers, and 1.67 (95%CI:0.66-4.25) for heavy drinkers,
      as compared with never drinkers. Adjustment for age, race, sex, and socioeconomic status
      resulted in an increase in RRs. The RRs comparing each level of alcohol intake with never
      drinkers for HF incidence were 1.12 (95%CI:0.95-1.31) for former drinkers, 0.67
      (95%CI:0.54-0.82) for occasional drinkers, 0.65 (95%CI:0.54-0.78) for light/moderate drinkers,
      and 0.75 (95%CI:0.59-0.95) for heavy drinkers. Similar patterns were seen for blacks and
      whites. We found no compelling evidence that occasional or light/moderate alcohol intake
      reduces stroke incidence rates. Adjusted RRs suggest that any level of alcohol intake
      increases hemorrhagic stroke incidence rates. We found a positive association for former
      drinking and an inverse association for current drinking for HF incidence. While the
      association between former drinkers and HF incidence was evident for whites, the evidence
      among blacks was less strong.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Knowledge is limited about risk factors for cancer pain experienced over the course of
      disease in specific tumor types. In this study, we assessed pain hazards using data originally
      collected over 51 weeks in a clinical trial among 1,124 women with metastatic breast cancer;
      pain was measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) severity and interference with daily
      living 0-10 subscales. Under a continuous time assumption, we conducted univariate
      (per-cutpoint) and multivariate (cutpoints 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 on the BPI) proportional hazards
      analyses to estimate effects of baseline characteristics on pain hazards. For the severity
      scale, compared with Caucasian race, non-Caucasian race was associated with 2.29 times the
      hazard of reaching severity cutpoint 7 versus 1.38 for cutpoint 3, all other covariates held
      constant. For the interference scale, compared with active baseline Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group (ECOG) status, restricted baseline ECOG status was associated with 2.97 times
      the hazard of reaching interference cutpoint 7 versus 2.00 for cutpoint 3. Under a categorical
      (interval-censored) time assumption, we used piecewise exponential models to estimate
      associations of baseline and time-dependent characteristics with "survival"
      rates for not yet reaching a score of 7 or above on each subscale, per 80-day interval.
      Estimated survival rates at the first interval were 0.92 for Caucasian women versus 0.80 for
      non-Caucasian women; for the interference scale, these rates were 0.80 versus 0.70,
      respectively. In subsequent intervals, rates declined similarly for Caucasian and
      non-Caucasian women, but for both pain outcomes, the cumulative survival rate for Caucasians
      in the last interval was still higher than that of non-Caucasians in the first interval. In
      confirming associations of ECOG performance status (both as a baseline and timedependent
      covariate) and race with pain hazards over time in metastatic breast cancer, our findings
      inform individualized prognoses for pain outcomes according to baseline patient attributes.
      Early intervention and more aggressive pain management strategies can be tailored to these
      personalized prognoses over the course of treatment, to delay first occurrence of higher pain
      scores among those at greatest risk. Future research should specifically target potential
      sources of racial disparities in cancer pain.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Biodegradation of PAHs by soil microbes is often hindered because the compounds are
      not always available to the microorganisms responsible for metabolism. Light microscopy, with
      digital photography and image analysis, was used to observed naphthalene dissolution. A small
      scale flow cell containing a naphthalene crystal was viewed at 100x magnification. Abiotic,
      biotic, and azide-inhibited systems were examined in this experimental system. Changes in the
      crystal's mass were determined from image analysis, and changes in the aqueous naphthalene's
      mass were determined with a fluorescence detector. Naphthalene's mass decreased approximately
      6 x 10-3 mg/hr, 1.5 x 10-3 mg/hr, and 1.0 x 10-3 mg/hr for abiotic, biotic, and
      azide-inhibited experiments, respectively. Cellular material around the crystal caused slower
      dissolution rates for the biotic and azide-inhibited experiments. There was no evidence that
      bacterial metabolism was occurring in the system. A model was developed which underestimated
      the dissolution rate by approximately one order of magnitude.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The rising prevalence of overweight throughout the world has prompted the recognition
      of a "global epidemic," with increases being partially attributed to
      populationlevel reductions in physical activity and increases in sedentary behaviors. In
      China, overweight has started to emerge as a significant public health concern. Prospective
      research on the relationship between physical activity and overweight is relatively uncommon
      in the developing world, and China offers a unique opportunity for study given the tremendous
      increases in urbanization and economic development seen in the recent past. Such growth can
      impact the physical activity patterns of individuals by driving concomitant increases in car
      ownership, in labor-saving household devices, in the mechanization of the workplace, as well
      as decreases in the proportion of the workforce employed in more physically-demanding
      occupations. The purpose of this research was to examine the impact of urbanization on the
      physical activity patterns of Chinese adults, as well as to investigate the impact of these
      changes on weight status. Analyses were conducted using data from the China Health and
      Nutrition Survey, an ongoing longitudinal study of a socioeconomically and demographically
      diverse sample of the Chinese population. Using multilevel models we showed that
      community-level urbanization was importantly associated with occupational activity after
      adjustment for individual-level sociodemographic factors. In subsequent analyses we found both
      occupational and household activity to be important predictors of weight in men and iv women,
      while leisure time and transportation activity did not have the same effect. This research
      helps to fill an important gap in understanding the impact of urbanization on physical
      activity and on subsequent overweight in an enormous transitioning populace.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin, CP) is a widely used anti-cancer agent.
      Its platinum analog (trans-R,R)1,2-diaminocyclohexaneoxalatoplatinum(II) (oxaliplatin, OX) is
      often effective in cisplatin resistant tumors and generally causes less mutation than CP.
      Although their carrier ligands are structurally distinct, CP and OX form the same types of
      adducts at the same sites on the DNA. Certain DNA regulatory proteins could distinguish CP-DNA
      adducts from OX-DNA adducts but the underlying mechanism is not clear currently. In this
      thesis, we utilized molecular dynamics computer simulation to study these two adducts and we
      found that DNA was more distorted on the 5' side of the adduct than the 3' side, CP adduct was
      oriented more towards the 5' side of the adduct and OX adduct more towards the 3' side and
      some significant differences were observed in the frequency distributions of DNA duplex
      helical parameters, which may provide an explanation to their distinct biological properties.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Chronic inflammation is a poorly understood, but problematic, manisfestation of sickle
      cell disease (SCD). The potent inflammatory mediator CD40L increases leukocyte proliferation,
      endothelial adhesiveness and procoagulant activity once it is exposed and released from
      encrypted sites following platelet activation. Since elevated leukocyte counts, adhesion and
      coagulation are associated with more clinically severe courses of SCD along with platelets
      that are more activated than normal, platelet CD40L is hypothesized to be an important
      mediator of inflammation in SCD. Data shown here indicate that CD40L is thirty-fold higher in
      SCD plasma but significantly reduced in SCD platelets. SCD plasma induces B cell
      proliferation, endothelial activation and procoagulant tissue factor production, all in a
      manner partially dependent on recognition of CD40L. When CD40L activity was blocked in a mouse
      model of SCD, lung, liver and kidney pathology was demonstrably reduced. More dramatically,
      anti-CD40L treatment of SCD mice prevented the architectural disruption and drastic
      enlargement of the spleen that is characteristic of SCD. These data suggest that functional
      CD40L is available and likely mediates inflammation in SCD. Furthermore, in a phase I clinical
      trial, the ?IIb?3 antagonist eptifibatide reduced plasma CD40L, favorably altered the
      inflammatory cytokine profile of SCD plasma and was well-tolerated by SCD patients. This study
      provides the first evidence that inflammation and organ pathology in SCD are mediated by
      plateletderived CD40L. Since plasma CD40L can be safely reduced by anti-platelet medication,
      we identify both CD40L and platelets as potential therapeutic targets to treat SCD.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The landscape of interactions between private industry and academia was changed by the
      passage of the Bayh-Dole act in 1980. This legislation allowed research institutions to retain
      the rights to discoveries made through federally funded research. The newfound ability to
      capitalize on scientific discoveries through patents and licensing created a new revenue
      source for universities. In addition, the preamble to the Act lists the promotion of
      collaboration between commercial concerns and nonprofit organizations as an objective. In
      recent years, researchers have also faced the reality that public funds for research are
      decreasing, further contributing to an increased reliance on corporate funding for research.
      Overall, corporate giving to universities grew from $850-million in 1985 to $4.25-billion a
      decade later. As industry support increases some argue that the risk to academic integrity may
      increase as well. In response to this concern, a myriad of documents have published
      documenting failures of industry - academic research relationships, warning of potential
      conflicts of interests and the threats to academic integrity. However, few have translated
      their growing discomfort into a forceful call for the changes needed to safeguard the autonomy
      and integrity of universities. Since the interaction between industry and universities will
      continue, it is iv important to identify ways to help them work together in the most effective
      manner while protecting the integrity of the research. The goal of this study was to develop
      guidelines to inform future academic-industry research relationships. The study's aims
      included: (1) identifying the characteristics of effective partnerships from the literature,
      (2) determining whether the characteristics of university-industry research relationships were
      similar to the characteristics identified in the literature, (3) assessing the degree to which
      these characteristics impacted perceived effectiveness of the university-industry research
      relationship. This study utilized mixed research methods approach -literature review,
      interviews, subject self rating using effectiveness scale, and expert panel review. The
      literature review identified the characteristics of effective partnerships from various
      disciplines. Semistructured interviews were conducted with principal investigators at major
      universities who received industry funding for research and industry representatives of
      companies that provided funding for university research. Subjects also self-rated the
      perceived effectiveness of their research relationship. The findings from the literature and
      the interviews were combined to develop guidelines that were reviewed by an expert panel. This
      research found that successful academic-industry research relationships possessed the
      characteristics of effective partnerships found in the literature. The research also
      identified specific processes that should be in place to ensure the success of the
      relationship and the maintenance of academic integrity. The recommended guidelines include
      suggestion that will assist future academic-industry research relationships in replicating the
      characteristics from the literature and incorporating the specific processes identified as
      important for relationship success.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Both apical periodontitis (AP) and tooth loss are among the most damaging dental
      diseases affecting humans. Only a few cross-sectional studies have been done as to RCT quality
      and post-operative AP in North America. Tooth loss has rarely been studied using survival
      analysis. The effect of AP and RCT on loss of individual teeth also has received little
      attention. This dissertation consists of two studies. The aims of Study One were to develop an
      explanatory model to evaluate the association between RCT quality and postoperative AP, and to
      assess whether and how this observed association is modified by the presence of pre-operative
      AP. The aims of Study Two were to determine a predictive model for tooth loss and assess the
      role of endodontic involvement in tooth loss after controlling for other established risk
      factors. The study population was from the Veterans Administration Dental Longitudinal Study
      (VADLS). Study One followed 609 teeth that received RCT at some time after baseline until the
      next examination cycle to determine the presence of post-operative AP. The main exposure
      variables were extension and density of the root filling (indicators of RCT quality).
      Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used to determine the relationship between
      extension, density and post-operative AP, while controlling for various covariates.
      Multivariate logistic regression models revealed that with adjustment for pre-operative AP, iv
      defective density was associated with an increased risk of post-operative AP (RR=3.0, 95%
      CI=1.3, 7.1), while pre-operative AP was the most significant risk factor (RR=29.2, 95%
      CI=13.6, 63.0). Study Two followed 18,798 teeth present at baseline until the date of tooth
      loss or the end of the study, whichever came first. The outcome was time to tooth loss.
      Multivariate marginal proportional hazards models revealed that, in addition to periodontal
      status and caries, both AP status and RCT status persisted as independent significant
      predictors for tooth loss (P&lt;0.01) after controlling for tooth type, number of proximal
      contacts, number of teeth at baseline, age, education level, and current smoking history.
      Traditional indicators of oral hygiene and plaque level may not be as important as other
      factors in predicting time to tooth loss.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Endothelial dysfunction plays an integral role in the pathogenesis and progression of
      cardiovascular disease in humans. The development of endothelial dysfunction has been
      primarily ascribed to functional impairments in nitric oxide biosynthesis. However,
      arachidonic acid metabolism by the cyclooxygenase and cytochrome P450 epoxygenase pathways
      also appears to regulate endothelial function. Consequently, genetic variation in these
      pathways may be important modifiers of cardiovascular disease risk in humans. The collective
      objective of the studies outlined in this doctoral dissertation was to determine if genetic
      variation in these established (NOS3, PTGS1 and PTGS2) and recently characterized (EPHX2,
      CYP2J2 and CYP2C8) pathways are significantly associated with cardiovascular disease risk.
      First, metabolic studies conducted in vitro demonstrate that certain genetic variants in
      cyclooxygenase-1 possess significantly lower metabolic activity compared to wild-type
      cyclooxygenase-1. Second, the observed associations between genetic variation in PTGS1, PTGS2
      and NOS3 and risk of incident coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke events further
      implicate these established pathways in the development of cardiovascular disease in humans.
      Third, the observed associations between genetic variation in EPHX2, CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 and
      risk of incident coronary heart disease events also demonstrate the potential importance of
      the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase pathway in the pathogenesis of ischemic cardiovascular disease
      in humans. Fourth, the development and baseline characterization of transgenic mice that
      exhibit vascular endothelial cell-specific overexpression of either human CYP2J2 or CYP2C8
      will enable further mechanistic characterization of the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase pathway in
      the regulation of endothelial function and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Breast cancer, the most common cancer diagnosed in women, is a complex and
      heterogeneous disease. In order to make the best treatment decision for a breast cancer
      patient, it is important to accurately determine that patient's risk of recurrence and the
      therapy to which that patient's tumor is most likely to respond. The prognostic and/or
      predictive factors currently accepted for use in primary breast cancer decision making (i.e.
      lymph node status, tumor size, nuclear grade, etc.) are not enough to accurately identify
      those patients who may require therapy and gives little information about what therapy they
      might best benefit from. Recent discoveries using gene expression profiling have greatly
      improved our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of breast cancer. We believe that
      gene expression profiling may also improve the prognostication and/or prediction of breast
      cancer outcomes, and thus, the main objective of this work has been to develop and test gene
      expression-based predictors of outcome in breast cancer patients. First, we developed an
      expression-based predictor of outcome for Estrogen Receptor (ER) and/or Progesterone Receptor
      (PR)-positive breast cancer patients using biological differences among these tumors. Second,
      we developed a predictor for objectively classifying tumors into one of five intrinsic
      subtypes and validated this using multiple test sets. Next, using a single patient dataset, we
      determined the concordance in outcome predictions made by several different gene expression
      profiles (developed on different platforms by different laboratories). Lastly, we developed
      gene expression-based predictors for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In summary, this
      work shows that gene expression profiling holds great promise in being clinically useful in
      the treatment decision-making process for breast cancer patients.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Auxiliary information is frequently used in survey sampling at the estimation stage to
      increase the precision of estimators. The class of calibration estimators introduced by
      Deville and S¨arndal (1992) is obtained by replacing the design weights with the so-called
      calibration weights, i.e. the closest weights from the design weights (with respect to a given
      divergence measure) that satisfy the constraints that incorporate the auxiliary information.
      The presence of covariate information in experimental design situations is similar to the
      presence of auxiliary information in survey sampling. Methods for nonparametric covariance
      adjustment from Quade (1967), Puri and Sen (1971), Koch et al. (1982), and Koch et al. (1998)
      are similar to the calibration methods for the two survey samples described by Zieschang
      (1990). In all these cases the covariance-adjusted estimators are obtained from the unadjusted
      estimators by minimizing a quadratic criterion subject to equal means constraints on the
      covariates. Ideas from survey sampling are used to generalize previously mentioned methods for
      nonparametric covariance adjustment. First, an empirical likelihood-based adjustment method is
      proposed for the construction of confidence intervals for the difference between means. A
      stratified version of the method and related methods that use criteria based on other
      divergence measures are described. Next, empirical likelihood-based adjustment methods are
      developed for the difference between more general parameters of interest under more general
      constraints. Finally, alternative empirical likelihood-based methods, that use a weighted
      empirical likelihood criterion, are developed for the construction of confidence intervals for
      the difference between means and stratified versions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>We have developed the first system, to our knowledge, that simultaneously measures 31P
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and optical action potentials (APs) in order to determine the
      dynamic relationship between certain metabolic markers and AP morphology during acute ischemia
      in rabbit hearts. Our system utilizes a ratiometric optical technique with transmembrane
      voltage-sensitive dye, di-4-ANEPPS, to measure APs with no pharmalogical motion inhibition.
      Fiber optics measure APs by passing light to and from the heart within an NMR magnet. 31P NMR
      measurements verified the stoichiometric relationship between inorganic phosphate and
      phosphocreatine; as phosphocreatine levels decrease, inorganic phosphate levels increase.
      During acute ischemia, intracellular pH levels remained constant and ;-ATP levels decreased
      22.4%. Simultaneous optical measurements show reductions in AP amplitude (-83.3%) and heart
      rate (-56.6%). AP duration increased (+875%), implicating other possible factors. These
      findings demonstrate a real-time correlation between ischemic depletion of high-energy
      phosphagens, and decreased AP amplitude and duration.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study aimed to validate that the computerized medical records within the General
      Practice Research Database (GPRD) can successfully identify congenital heart defects.
      Specifically, ventricular septal defect (VSD), Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and coarctation of
      the aorta (COA) were examined. Additional information from 1) medical record abstraction
      "questionnaires" sent to general practitioners and 2) maternal and infant
      free text comments fields within the GPRD was obtained. This information was compared to
      computerized medical records to understand which available components of the GPRD provide
      maximal information about congenital heart defects. This study also created case definitions
      of congenital heart defects within the GPRD and examined whether the prevalence rates of
      congenital heart defects for 2001-2003 obtained from the GPRD are similar to those obtained
      from two UK population-based systems, the National Congenital Anomaly System (NCAS) and the
      European Concerted Action of Congenital Anomalies and Twins (EUROCAT). Using practitioner
      questionnaires as the "gold standard," an overall positive predictive value
      (PPV) of the computerized medical record of 93% for the three defects was achieved. Of the 200
      records, 44% contained infant free text information pertaining to the congenital heart defect
      of interest: the availability did not vary by specific defect. The proportion of infant defect
      information in the mother's free text was low. The prevalence of all heart defects from the
      GPRD was more than twice as high as in the NCAS and slightly higher than in the EUROCAT. All
      prevalence rate differences reached statistical significance (P=0.05). This study confirmed
      with a high positive predictive value that computerized GPRD medical records are sufficient to
      assess VSD, TOF and COA. It also demonstrated that the GPRD has the potential to produce a
      more complete estimate of prevalence of congenital heart defects compared to currently
      available UK national systems. The advantages of the GPRD as a medical records database
      including case ascertainment methods that do not rely on voluntary reporting, a theoretically
      unlimited duration of follow-up time in which a case can be detected and the availability of
      infant free text information make the GPRD a unique source for future studies of congenital
      heart defects.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Previous studies in the mouse model have reported that maternal infection with
      Campylobacter rectus, a periodontal pathogen, is associated with intrauterine fetal growth
      restriction. To that end, we hypothesized that maternal immunization prior to challenge with
      C. rectus would protect the fetus from growth restriction. Prior to mating, mice in one
      treatment arm received immunization via an intra-chamber challenge of heat-killed C. rectus
      314. On gestation day (Gd) 7.5, pregnant mice in the treatment groups received an intrachamber
      challenge of live C. rectus at concentrations of 109 CFU/ml. Pregnant mice were sacrificed on
      Gd 16.5 and fetuses evaluated for weight, and crown-rump length. Maternal serum was collected
      and maternal antibody response was evaluated. Fetuses from the C. rectus challenged group had
      shorter crown-rump lengths and weighed significantly less than the immunized group and the
      control group. Maternal serum of the immunized group displayed marked elevations of IgG
      antibody to C. rectus compared to the non-immunized and control group. In conclusion,
      immunization of pregnant dams with heat-killed C. rectus provides a robust maternal IgG
      response and protects against fetal growth restriction. In addition, C. rectus virulence
      factors that may have a possible role in fetal growth restriction were investigated. The genes
      peb4, cadF, cdtB and ciaB that have been identified as virulence genes and sequenced in other
      Campylobacter species were examined for their presence in C. rectus. To that end, the genome
      sequences of 4 Campylobacter spp. (C. jejuni, C. lari, C. coli and C. upsaliensis) were used
      to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers to attempt detection and isolation of these genes
      in C. rectus. Although a match was not found at the nucleotide level, investigation of matches
      at the protein level revealed similarities with cytochrome c552 of C. jejuni RM1221,
      NADP-dependent malic enzyme from C. fetus subsp. fetus and mannose-1-phosphate
      guanylyltransferase/mannose-6-phosphate isomerase from C. fetus subsp. fetus. This is
      significant for future attempts to obtain genomic sequences from C. rectus and warrants
      further study.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Approximately two out of every one thousand live births have a complex congenital
      heart defect (CHD) that creates a univentricular physiology. As a result of the altered
      physiology, the overloaded single ventricle pumps both oxygenated and deoxygenated blood to
      parallel pulmonary and systemic circulations. Since 1971, when Fontan and Baudet were first
      successful in treating patients with tricuspid atresia with an atriopulmonary (AP) repair,
      operations that place the pulmonary and systemic circulations in series with the single pump
      have been termed "Fontan Repairs". The current repair of choice bypasses the
      right side of the heart, connecting the superior and inferior cava directly to the pulmonary
      arteries. Such repairs are termed total cavopulmonary connections (TCP) and have various
      modifications: graft size, connection angles, materials used, etc. Though most Fontan patients
      lead relatively normal lives, most also suffer some complications, ranging from exercise
      intolerance to life threatening GI disorders, whose causes are yet to be determined. One
      prominent characteristic of the Fontan circulation is an increased influence of respiration,
      which also is not well understood, but may be related to other complications. This research
      investigated various Fontan modifications not available via computer simulation by
      implementing surgical designs in-vivo in lambs and collecting pressure and flow data in
      various vessels and chambers. Data were obtained in four models, the AP connection and three
      models of the TCP connection: total cavopulmonary connection without a synthetic graft (TCPC),
      extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection with graft (TCPX), and the total cavopulmonary
      connection using a Y-shaped graft (TCPY). The overall hypothesis is that a fundamental
      understanding of modified Fontan repairs will lead to improved surgical planning and designs
      and thus the potential for long term outcomes in patients. Specific Aims were to: 1)
      Investigate the effects of ventilation parameters on hemodynamics under normal and various
      Fontan modifications, 2) Determine power losses of various Fontan circulations under varying
      physiological parameters, 3) Determine time offsets regarding positive pressure ventilation
      (PPV) for implementation in an electrical computer simulation model and 4) Determine
      feasibility and establish protocol at UNC for geometry and velocity mapping via MRI.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Researchers using tailored messages in cancer prevention intervention studies have not
      sufficiently studied how best to tailor messages about multiple behaviors. One important
      question is whether behavioral change strategies and feedback should include only behaviors
      participants indicate they most want to work on (i.e. a behavioral priority) or behaviors
      selected on their behalf based on expert evidence of potential disease prevention benefit.
      Compared to expert-based tailoring, tailoring to participants' behavioral priorities may be of
      greater relevance, prompting information processing, and ultimately facilitating behavioral
      changes. This dissertation included three lines of research. First, from six focus groups, we
      elicited participants' perceptions about components of a healthy lifestyle and used this
      information to design a tailored feedback graphic. Second, we conducted secondary analyses of
      data from two large worksite intervention trials, in which subsets of female participants
      received tailored messages. Results indicated that those who chose the 'healthy eating'
      priority and received a tailored message increased servings of fruits and vegetables by
      1.8-2.0 compared to women who had also chosen 'healthy eating' but did not receive a tailored
      message. Building from these results, we conducted a randomized web-based trial to directly
      evaluate tailoring to participantselected behavioral priorities versus expert-based health
      behaviors and a non-tailored comparison group. Six cancer prevention guidelines for nutrition
      and physical activity were targeted. Immediately before and after reading the tailored or
      non-tailored feedback on-screen, we measured guideline-specific intention, self-efficacy, goal
      commitment, and goal difficulty. Female college students (n=408), 74% non-Hispanic white,
      participated. Overall, support for tailoring to behavioral priorities was found for increasing
      fruits and vegetables and physical activity with statistically significant improvements in
      self-efficacy, goal commitment, and goal difficulty. Even stronger effects on these variables
      were found among participants randomized to the expert-tailored group, but only among those
      who received a message that happened to match their selected behavioral priority. Overall,
      results from this dissertation support tailoring to behavioral priorities and provide a tool
      to increase message effectiveness. Tailored health communications effective in facilitating
      healthful nutrition and physical activity choices have the potential to impact cancer
      incidence population-wide.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread soil and sediment pollutants,
      and the carcinogenic nature of some PAHs has led to increased concern over their potential
      effects on human health and the environment. Salicylate is an inducer of PAH metabolism in
      many bacteria, and its addition to contaminated soil or sediment has been proposed as a means
      of stimulating PAH degradation during bioremediation. Stable-isotope probing (SIP), a
      technique which uses 13C-labeled growth substrates to link microbial function with identity
      via selective recovery of "heavy" 13C-labeled DNA, was used to identify
      degraders of salicylate, naphthalene, and phenanthrene in an aerobic slurry-phase bioreactor
      treating PAH-contaminated soil. Salicylate- and naphthalene-degraders were similar to each
      other but not to phenanthrene degraders. SIP was also used to identify organisms enriched for
      by alternative methods of salicylate addition: spike (all at once) or continuous (slow
      addition throughout the incubation). Spike and continuous salicylate addition were found to
      select for differing populations of salicylate utilizers. Real-time quantitative PCR primers
      were designed to quantify the abundances of organisms selected for by each salicylate addition
      method. To evaluate salicylate as a stimulant of PAH degradation, the effect of spike or
      continuous salicylate addition on initial mineralization rates of naphthalene, phenanthrene,
      and benzo[a]pyrene was measured. Spike addition of salicylate was found to increase the
      mineralization of naphthalene by 50% relative to the unenriched control. The combined results
      of this study suggest that (1) the method of substrate addition affects the outcome of SIP
      incubations, and (2) salicylate has the potential to stimulate naphthalene removal in
      contaminated systems.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In prevention of mother to child HIV transmission programs, nurses are responsible for
      counseling HIV-infected mothers about infant feeding. Studies of nurses' infant feeding
      counseling in African countries suggest that counseling quality is often poor and may be
      associated with nursing culture, inadequate training, and health system factors. Few studies,
      however, have conducted theory-informed process evaluations to assess nurses' implementation
      of an infant feeding counseling protocol. This study conducted the process evaluation of an
      infant feeding counseling protocol for the Breastfeeding, Antiretroviral and Nutrition (BAN)
      Study, an ongoing clinical trial in Lilongwe, Malawi. Six nurses, trained on World Health
      Organization recommendations, counseled HIV-infected mothers to exclusively breastfeed for 6
      months and stop breastfeeding at 6 months. This study adapted and applied patient-provider
      communication theoretical concepts to assess nurses' counseling behaviors through: (1) direct
      observation and audio-taping of 123 infant feeding counseling sessions (30 antenatal and 93
      postnatal) using a checklist to document nurses' adherence to specific protocol items; and (2)
      in-depth interviews with each nurse to document adherence perceptions and attitudes toward the
      protocol. Analysis included calculating a percent adherence of checklists and constant
      comparison techniques and visual display matrices for the observation and interview data.
      Results indicate that nurses were implementing the protocol at an average adherence level of
      90% or above. Adherence to protocol items during the antenatal sessions was 100%. During
      postnatal sessions, adherence ranged from 92.7% to 97.8%. Nurses' implementation
      inconsistencies occurred when addressing breast health and breastfeeding cessation issues. An
      unexpected finding was nurses counseling mothers on proper infant formula preparation,
      although not detailed in the protocol. Interviews revealed a high nurse to mother ratio and
      additional counseling training on infant formula and complementary feeding preparation as
      perceived barriers toward complete protocol adherence. Findings illustrate that with minimal
      training, nurses implemented the BAN Study infant feeding counseling protocol as designed. The
      process evaluation results will help to interpret the BAN Study's impact and health outcomes
      related to evaluating mother's feasibility to follow infant feeding recommendations. The
      implication for HIV/AIDS clinical trials is to conduct process evaluations to identify and
      address potential implementation inconsistencies and, thereby, improve protocol implementation
      adherence.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Background. Drug resistance is a major obstacle to the control of Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria. Monitoring the efficacy of antimalarials is a critical component to
      malaria control. One possible surveillance method is to use molecular markers. However, their
      relationship with clinical resistance needs to be established before they can be used.
      Methods. Clinical samples from an in vivo efficacy study of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP)
      based therapy in Rutshuru, Democratic Republic of Congo were used to estimate the effect of
      mutations in dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) on treatment
      failure. In addition, clinical samples from an in vivo efficacy study of mefloquineartesunate
      in Pailin, Cambodia were used to estimate the effect of changes in the P. falciparum multidrug
      resistance-1 (pfmdr1) gene on recrudescence. Lastly, a cross-sectional survey of Cambodia was
      conducted to determine the geographic distribution of the genetic changes in pfmdr1. Results.
      In Rutshuru, the effect of mutations at dhps-437 and dhps-540 on SP treatment failure differed
      by level of parasitemia: for children with low parasitemia, the presence of both mutations was
      associated with a 17% (95%CI: -3%, 36%) greater absolute risk of treatment failure compared to
      having neither mutation (baseline risk: 21%). For children with high parasitemia, the risk
      difference was 50% (95%CI: 35%, 64%; baseline risk: 8%). In Pailin, pfmdr1 copy number was
      strongly related to time to recrudescence after mefloquine-artesunate treatment (adjusted HR =
      7.91, 95%CI: 2.38, 26.29). In the cross-sectional study of Cambodia, increased pfmdr1 copy
      number was found not only in Pailin, where mefloquine resistance has been well documented, but
      also in Chumkiri, an area not previously known for drug resistance. Conclusion. These studies
      demonstrated dhps mutations are associated with SP treatment failure in the DRC and pfmdr1
      copy number is associated with recrudescence after mefloquine-artesunate treatment in
      Cambodia. The cross-sectional study demonstrates how the use of a molecular marker can be
      operationalized to detect resistant areas outside of current sentinel surveillance sites.
      Detecting dhps mutations in DRC and pfmdr1 copy number in Cambodia are potentially
      cost-effective methods to complement the current in vivo efficacy monitoring of drug
      resistance in these countries.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The phospholipase C (PLC) family of enzymes mediates signal transduction events
      initiated at the cell surface by a myriad of receptors. When activated by signaling pathways
      initiated by cell surface receptors, PLC enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of the minor membrane
      lipid, phosphatidyl inositol (4,5) bis-phosphate into the second messengers, diacylglycerol
      and inositol (1,4,5) tris-phosphate. These second messengers then stimulate the activity of
      protein kinase C and the release of intracellular calcium levels to regulate a vast array of
      cellular responses. The PLC family of enzymes is composed of six subfamilies all containing a
      conserved core architecture. This structural core is elaborated by various accessory domains,
      which facilitate the binding of activators and confer tight and specific regulation of PLC
      activity downstream of diverse signaling cascades. To gain an understanding of the molecular
      mechanisms of such regulation we have determined the structures of the conserved core of
      PLC-[beta]2 in the absence and presence of its activator, the small GTPase, Rac1. These
      structures and the accompanying biochemical characterization reveal the overall organization
      of the enzyme and elucidate several mechanisms of its activation. The work presented here
      greatly expands the understanding of PLC regulation and builds the foundation for further work
      aimed at identifying the physiological role of PLC signaling cascades.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Neutrophils are central effector cells in innate immune defense and their timely
      arrival leads to death of invading microbes within hours of infection. Defects in the
      generation or function of neutrophils are predisposing risk factors for life-threatening
      infections. Antimicrobials, key components of the bactericidal arsenal, are known to originate
      from cells of innate immunity, including those of neutrophils and macrophages. In the
      epithelia of the intestinal tract and the airway, these peptides also reside and participate
      in host defense by keeping commensals in check, as well as protecting from environmentally
      introduced microbes. Here we describe functional characterization of a novel protein termed
      ONZIN, whose expression profile, mimicking that of an antimicrobial, is consistent with a role
      in immune defense mechanisms. While neutrophils deficient in ONZIN appear to have normal
      chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and oxidative burst, they are unable to efficiently eliminate
      microbes. To better understand the functional activity of ONZIN, recombinant proteins were
      produced. Although the recombinant ONZIN did not display direct antimicrobial activity,
      studies with ONZIN deficient mice demonstrate that ONZIN is necessary in neutrophils for
      optimal intracellular killing of bacteria. Further studies, examining the role of ONZIN in
      atopic diseases, suggested that ONZIN is also required for development of a normal T cell
      response in mice. Taken together, these studies support a role for ONZIN in immune defense,
      not only for the innate immune response mediated by phagocytes but also for mounting an
      adaptive immune response mediated by T cells.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Problem: Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants are vulnerable to cold stress
      during the first 12 hours of life (extra-uterine transition) due to stabilization in the
      delivery room and NICU. Little research has examined thermoregulation in ELBW infants or the
      body temperature range that would lead to optimal physiological status. Purpose: The purpose
      of this study was to explore the physiological aspects of thermoregulation as a first step
      toward determining the optimal body temperature for ELBW infants during transition. The study
      used a multiple case design to explore the relationships between body temperature and
      oxygenation, heart rate, peripheral vasoconstriction, acid-base balance, and blood glucose in
      10 ELBW infants over their first 12 hours in the NICU. Methodology: Infants were continuously
      monitored from admission to the NICU for 12 hours. Ten variables were collected using
      physiologic monitoring, observation and chart review. Results: Infants had a mean abdominal
      temperature range of 35.17; C to 36.68; C. One infant exhibited peripheral vasoconstriction
      8.8% of the time, and the remaining nine had poor vasomotor control, appearing to lack the
      ability to vasoconstrict. The peripheral temperature was greater than the abdominal
      temperature for the most of the study period for 7 of 10 infants. Abdominal-peripheral
      temperature differences significantly increased for 9 of the 10 infants when abdominal
      temperature A 36.4; C. Caregiver handling of the infant was associated with an increase in the
      abdominal-peripheral temperature difference on graphic trends. Abdominal temperature and heart
      rate were significantly correlated in 7 of 10 infants. In addition, more observations in the
      normal heart rate range for 6 of 10 infants when abdominal temperatures were greater than
      36.4;C. The abdominal temperature range in which normal heart rates for the ELBW infants in
      this study were maximized was 36.8;C to 37.0;C. Relevance to Nursing: These results will add
      to the data to guide nurses in setting control points for body temperature, inform nurses when
      it is necessary to augment incubator heat with additional heat sources, and help nurses guard
      against cold stress during stabilization procedures.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The receptor tyrosine kinase Mer (MerTK) is expressed by dendritic cells (DC) in mice.
      The heretofore undefined role of MerTK in DC was investigated in two major studies. First, the
      role of MerTK in the inhibition of DC activation by apoptotic cells was investigated. It was
      found that apoptotic cells inhibited DC activation by bacterial lipopolysaccharide or CD40
      crosslinking via MerTK. Inhibition of DC was characterized by blockade of IL-12p70 secretion,
      co-stimulatory molecule expression and stimulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The MerTK ligand
      growth arrest specific factor-6 (Gas6) was expressed on the surface of apoptotic cells, and
      Gas6 was essential for the inhibitory effects of apoptotic cells upon DC. Non-obese diabetic
      (NOD) mice, lacking MerTK expression (NOD.MerTKKD/KD), demonstrated aberrant expansion of type
      1 CD4+ and CD8+ T cell effectors in response to apoptotic cell death in vivo. Furthermore,
      NOD.MerTKKD/KD mice expressing a diabetogenic T cell receptor transgene, developed diabetes at
      an accelerated rate and a greater frequency than mice expressing MerTK. These findings support
      a role for MerTK in peripheral immune homeostasis. Secondly, the impact of MerTK-deficiency in
      NOD mice was investigated. NOD.MerTKKD/KD mice were protected from diabetes onset and
      protection was due to lack of self-specific type 1 CD4+ and CD8+ T cell effectors. Thymic
      selection was enhanced in NOD.MerTKKD/KD mice resulting in deletion of pathogenic,
      autoreactive T cells. The change in thymic selection efficiency was mediated by bone
      marrow-derived cells and was likely due to dysregulation of thymic DC. These data indicate
      that MerTK mediates immunoregulation of DC in both the periphery and the thymus.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Arsenic is an environmental contaminant that can induce lung cancer via ingestion or
      inhalation. Arsenic undergoes a series of metabolic changes in the body were the inorganic
      species of the semi-metal (commonly found in the environment) undergo a series of redox and
      methylation reactions. Recent evidence suggests that organic trivalent arsenicals might be
      more cytotoxic and genotoxic than inorganic arsenicals. Several hypotheses have been proposed
      to explain its carcinogenic mode of action but no definitive conclusion has been documented.
      However, multiple studies suggest that arsenic might potentiate the effects of other agents.
      The purpose of this project was to evaluate the cytotoxicity and DNA damage potential of
      organic (dimethylarsine iodide, DMAs3+) and inorganic (sodium arsenite, iAs3+) arsenic
      compounds to human bronchial epithelial cells and whether the arsenicals had any effect on
      hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage. Hydrogen peroxide is present in the airways due to
      cellular metabolism, and is increased in response to inflammation. We found that DMAs3+ was
      more cytotoxic and induced more DNA damage (as assessed via the alkaline single cell gel
      electrophoresis assay) than iAs3+ after exposure for 4 h in the BEAS- 2B (transformed human
      bronchial epithelium) cell line. However, both arsenic compounds sensitized the BEAS-2B cells
      to H2O2-induced DNA damage. Upon further examination of the factors that could account for the
      sensitization we found that the BEAS-2B cells accumulate more As after exposure to DMAs3+ than
      after exposure to iAs3+. This finding could partly explain the sensitization observed, thus,
      we assessed whether blocking As efflux transporters would affect the sensitization to H2O2.
      However, no significant changes were observed between the cells that had received the efflux
      transporter inhibitors and the controls. We also assessed whether reduced glutathione (GSH)
      was involved in the results observed. After increasing or decreasing cellular GSH we observed
      that DMAs3+-induced sensitization of the cells to H2O2-induced DNA damage is dependent on the
      levels of GSH. An increase in GSH levels attenuates the sensitization, and a decrease in GSH
      increases the sensitization. It is possible that GSH serves a protective role in airway
      epithelial cells by scavenging methylated arsenic compounds.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The herbicide atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine, ATR) is
      used to control growth of broadleaf and grassy weeds. It has been registered with the United
      States Environmental Protection Agency and is monitored to prevent unsafe levels of this
      possible endocrine disrupting compound from reaching human and animal populations via
      contaminated surface or ground water. Life-time feeding studies on ATR have shown an increased
      incidence and decreased time to tumors in mammary glands (MG) of rats, via its long-term
      effects on the brain and altered estrous cyclicity. This thesis focuses on changes observed in
      developing MG of female Long Evans rats (offspring and dam) exposed during late gestation to
      ATR. It also explores possible confounders of observed effects including body weights,
      pubertal timing, and serum hormone concentrations. Dams were gavage dosed with 100 mg/kg ATR
      during late gestation corresponding to fetal mammary bud development and outgrowth. That
      exposure caused a delay in puberty and mammary development in female offspring. From
      cross-fostered litters, it was determined that nursing from an ATR-treated dam delayed both
      puberty and mammary development. However, a brief transplacental exposure to ATR caused delays
      only in MG development that persist into adulthood. MG development was most delayed in
      offspring exposed during fetal mammary epithelial cell proliferation (GD17-19), but it was
      also delayed in offspring exposed only by nursing from dams treated during that same time.
      These results suggested that ATR may reprogram fetal and neonatal MG development. These
      findings suggested changes in dam MG development or lactation. MG from ATR-exposed dams were
      developmentally different from those of controls at early timepoints. ATR and its metabolites
      were detected in the urine, amniotic fluid, and serum of treated dams at several timepoints
      post exposure suggesting that ATR metabolites may be available to the developing offspring
      until at least PND11 when abnormal MG development has been detected in female pups. These
      studies taken together suggest that ATR can have long-term effects on the MG of female
      offspring and dams without association of confounders. The effects of this brief exposure are
      persistent, extending into adulthood and affecting weight gain of future generations via the
      lactational effects.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>RhoGTPases are involved in regulating important cellular processes including
      cytoskeletal organization, gene transcription and membrane vesicle transport - poising
      RhoGTPases to link these pathways to HIV-1 replication. However, RhoGTPase function in HIV-1
      replication is essentially unknown. RhoA activation can be modulated by the cytoplasmic tail
      of the HIV-1 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein through its interaction with p115RhoGEF, a
      RhoA specific activator. Furthermore, activation of the RhoA signaling pathway inhibits HIV-1
      gene expression. To investigate how RhoA pathways modulate HIV-1 replication, I tested
      individual RhoA effectors. Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) specifically inhibits HIV-1 gene
      expression in T cells. A ROCK specific inhibitor counteracts RhoA inhibition of HIV-1 gene
      expression, indicating that RhoA signals via ROCK to inhibit HIV-1. HIV-1 LTR mutations in
      either the NF-kappa-B or Sp1 binding sites abrogate ROCK-mediated inhibition. ROCK may disrupt
      the cooperative interaction between NF-?B and Sp1 or modulate epigenetic regulation to inhibit
      HIV-1 gene expression. Additionally, I identified a disparate role for the RhoA effector,
      citron kinase. Citron kinase preferentially enhances HIV-1 virion production by promoting
      exocytosis. This activity depends on the leucine zipper, Rho-binding and zinc-finger domains,
      but not the kinase activity, of citron kinase. Although citron kinase-mediated enhancement of
      HIV-1 replication is late domain independent, an intact late endosomal sorting pathway is
      required. Citron kinase may act as a scaffold, linking host proteins to the endosomal sorting
      and exosomal pathways. I also found a functional interaction between citron kinase and the
      ESCRT-I component, Tsg101. Ectopic expression of either citron kinase or Tsg101 enhances HIV-1
      virion production, however, coexpression of citron kinase and Tsg101 inhibits HIV-1
      replication. This functional interaction is mediated by the kinase activity of citron and the
      PTAP-binding region of Tsg101. The two activities of citron kinase involved in HIV-1
      regulation are distinct and independent of one another. In summary, I identified two RhoA
      effectors, ROCK and citron kinase to regulate HIV-1 replication. ROCK specifically inhibits
      HIV-1 gene expression while citron kinase demonstrates a disparate role. These RhoA effectors
      may provide novel targets for developing antiviral therapeutics and further our understanding
      of the role of RhoA signaling pathways in HIV-1 replication.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Several epidemiological studies have confirmed the associations and estimated the risk
      of cardiovascular and pulmonary mortality due to short term exposure to PM10. However the
      errors introduced by techniques previously used to interpolate PM10 in characterizing the
      strength of the associations remain in question. Therefore we incorporate the Bayesian Maximum
      Entropy (BME) method of modern spatiotemporal Geostatistics in the exposure assessment to
      investigate the effect that daily PM10 has on cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in
      different regions of Thailand. The BME maps show that the PM10 field across Thailand exhibits
      considerable space/time variability. These maps suggest that the PM10 daily average
      concentration did not comply with the PM10 standard, which is supported by the maps of PM10
      daily maximum concentration, and confirmed by BME maps of non-attainment areas. Furthermore,
      the BME analysis targeted districts in the Northeast region as sites where new monitoring
      stations should be added in order to improve the Thailand's existing monitoring network. These
      maps provided the most accurate estimate of PM10 exposure obtained to date for each district
      location and day for which cardiovascular and respiratory mortality was reported in Thailand
      during 1998-2003. The strength of the associations was then investigated through an analysis
      using a case-crossover design. The observed associations were stronger for pulmonary mortality
      than for cardiovascular mortality. The high odds ratios observed in Bangkok and the central
      region were possibly due to industrialization, construction, and traffic emission sources
      while positive associations found in other regions could be related to sources from
      agricultural biomass burning, forest fire, windblown dust, and sea spray. Furthermore, a
      holistochastic human exposure analysis propagated mapping and epidemiologic uncertainty to
      obtain the lower-bound and upper-bound estimates of the number of deaths from cardiovascular
      and respiratory causes that resulted from acute health response to short term exposure to PM10
      across Thailand. An Elasticity uncertainty analysis suggests that the uncertainty in the
      assessment of the number of deaths caused by PM10 can be improved by adding monitoring
      stations in the Northeastern region, and by improving the epidemiologic study in the Northern
      region.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>While much is known about the effect of clinical factors such as tumor characteristics
      and molecular markers on breast cancer survival, little is known about the impact of
      non-clinical factors on survival. Reproductive factors play an important role in the
      development of breast cancer, and oral contraceptive use is associated with a modest increase
      in incidence but their impact on survival is unclear. This study examined whether reproductive
      factors and oral contraceptives were associated with survival among younger breast cancer
      cases. A population-based cohort of women diagnosed with a first, primary, invasive breast
      cancer between 1990-1992, aged 20-54 years (n=1264), were followed until January 1, 2000.
      Detailed information on a variety of characteristics was collected through structured
      in-person interviews given shortly after diagnosis. Vital status was ascertained through the
      National Death Index (n=292 deaths). Cox regression methods were used to estimate adjusted
      hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Relative to nulliparity, parity of 4 or
      more births was positively associated with all-cause mortality, [HR (95%CI) = 1.71
      (1.09-2.67)]. Increased mortality was observed for having a recent birth prior to diagnosis
      (?5 vs. &gt;5 years) [1.78 (1.28-2.47)], and was more pronounced among women with a
      pre-diagnostic body mass index of &lt;25 kg/m2 [2.54 (1.61-4.00)]. Early age at menarche
      and early age at first birth also modestly increased mortality; history of miscarriage,
      induced abortion, and ever breastfeeding were not related to survival. Relative to non-recent
      OC use, recent use of OCs just prior to diagnosis increased all-cause mortality, both for time
      since first use [&lt;10 years versus 20+ years = 1.77 (0.98-3.21)] and last use [&lt;1
      year versus 1+ year = 1.46 (0.91-2.33)]. In particular, the HR was doubled for use of high
      dose estrogen pills versus low dose use within 5 years of diagnosis [2.38 (1.22-4.62)], or if
      the most recent pill included the progestin levonorgestrel (versus all other types) [2.00
      (1.03-3.87)]. These results implicate the timing of hormonal characteristics in breast cancer
      progression and may enable a better understanding of how reproductive characteristics and oral
      contraceptive use influence breast cancer survival.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In order to gain a better understanding of dose-dependant metabolism of benzene and
      interindividual variation, we analyzed air benzene, urinary metabolites and personal
      information, including single nucleotide polymorphisms of key metabolic enzymes, from 389
      subjects exposed to benzene occupationally/environmentally. The apparent levels of benzene
      metabolites increased with exposure, and levels of benzene metabolites were unambiguously
      different from background levels at: ~ 0.2 ppm for E,E-muconic acid (MA) and
      Sphenylmercapturic acid (SPMA), ~ 0.5 ppm for phenol (PH) and hydroquinone (HQ), and ~2 ppm
      for catechol (CA). After adjustment for the background levels, MA, PH, CA and HQ showed
      significant (p&lt;0.001) downward trends of dose-related production between 0.027 and 15.4
      ppm. The transitions were particularly accentuated at lower exposure (0.027 and 0.274 ppm) for
      all metabolites. These were confirmed with generalized linear models with natural splines
      (GLM+NS). Based on analysis using the molar fraction, CYP-mediated metabolic pathways favored
      MA and HQ below 20 ppm and favored PH and CA above 20 ppm. Noticeably, ~90% of the reductions
      in dose-specific levels occurred below ~3 ppm for each major metabolite. Metabolite levels
      were about 20% higher in females and decreased between one and 2% per year of life. Also,
      levels of HQ and CA were greater in smokers. After adjustment for age, gender, BMI and smoking
      status, the following SNPs showed significant effect on various metabolites, either as main
      effects or as interactions with benzene exposure and/or smoking: NQO1*2 for all metabolites,
      CYP2E1 for all metabolites except CA, GSTT1 and GSTM1 for SPMA, EPHX1 (Ex4+52A&gt;G) for
      SPMA and CA, and EPHX1 (Ex3-28T&gt;C) for CA. Interestingly, variant alleles of all genes
      [except EPHX1 (Ex4+52A&gt;G)] appeared to be associated with lower levels of benzene
      metabolites relative to homozygous wild alleles. In conclusion, our results indicate that
      benzene metabolism is highly nonlinear with increasing benzene exposure above 0.03 ppm, and
      that metabolism shifts away from CA and PH at low doses in favor of MA and HQ. Also,
      metabolism of benzene is modulated by exposure, gender, age, smoking, and genetic
      polymorphisms.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Gliomas are the most common and potentially most fatal of brain tumors. With few leads
      emerging, focus has reshifted to the consistent predisposition of glial tumors toward males.
      Previous studies using reproductive factors to evaluate whether hormones may play a role in
      gliomagenesis have been largely inconclusive. Using the population-based San Francisco Adult
      Glioma Study, we evaluated whether reproductive factors and exogenous hormone use were
      independently associated with gliomas and went further to evaluate cumulative exposure.
      Overall, reproductive and menstrual factors were not associated with gliomas. However, inverse
      associations were observed for ever exogenous hormone use (oral contraceptive use (OC):
      adjusted odd ratio (AOR) = 0.73, 95% CI, 0.49-1.10; postmenopausal hormone use (PHT): AOR =
      0.53, 95% CI: 0.33-0.86). Risk estimates decreased with increasing duration of OC use among
      ever users. OC users who subsequently used PHT were at significantly reduced risk of gliomas
      (AOR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.21-0.99), but departures from the multiplicative and additive scales
      were not statistically significant. Cumulative exposure was defined multiple ways and showed
      no clear pattern of association. Analysis by smoking status and histologic subtype was
      unrevealing. As a second line of investigation, we used the same parent study to evaluate
      whether DNA repair polymorphisms XRCC1 Arg399Gln, MGMT Leu84Phe, and MGMT Ile143Val were
      associated with gliomas among male and female participants. Significant associations were not
      found between XRCC1 and MGMT polymorphisms and gliomas. The adjusted odds ratio of the XRCC1
      399Gln variant among whites was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.72-1.28). A weak positive association (AOR =
      1.26; CI, 0.90-1.75) was observed for the MGMT Leu84Phe polymorphism (Leu or Phe/Phe versus
      Leu/Leu), an association that was stronger among males (AOR = 1.75; CI,1.12-2.74) and
      non-glioblastoma cases (AOR = 1.54; CI, 1.02-2.34). DNA repair polymorphisms did not notably
      modify risk estimates for the smoking-glioma association, suggesting little evidence of a
      multiplicative or additive joint effect between genotypes and cigarette smoking. Two way
      genegene interactions of XRCC1 and previously associated ERCC1 and ERCC2 repair genes were
      unremarkable.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Lyme disease is caused by the tick-borne spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi. The
      spirochete produces over 100 membrane anchored lipoproteins. One lipoprotein, designated VlsE,
      changes its antigenic properties through DNA recombination, most likely to evade adaptive
      immune responses in the host. Here we demonstrate that VlsE is on the surface of the
      spirochete and exposed to the outside. Our hypothesis is that vlsE recombination is active in
      the host but not in the tick, which does not have an adaptive immune system. We characterized
      the number of vlsE alleles present in culture and at different stages of the Borrelia life
      cycle in the vector and host. The locus was stable in culture and in ticks, unlike in mice
      where many novel recombinants were readily observed. These results support the hypothesis that
      vlsE recombination is more frequent in the host than in ticks.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study was designed to investigate the effect of selenium (Se) or vitamin C
      deficiency on the immune response to infection with influenza virus. In the first part of the
      study, we tested whether Se deficiency would affect the immune response and subsequent lung
      pathology in mice infected with a virulent, mouse-adapted strain of influenza virus, influenza
      A/Puerto Rico/8/34. In the second part of the study, we tested whether the deficiency or
      supplementation of another important nutrient, vitamin C, could affect the immune response to
      influenza infection. Because mice can synthesize vitamin C, we utilized a gulonolactone
      knockout mouse (gulo -/-) model for our vitamin C deficiency studies. There were no
      differences in lung influenza A/PR8/34 viral titers between the Seadequate and the
      Se-deficient mice, or differences in lung influenza A/Bangkok/1/79 viral titers between the
      vitamin C-adequate and the vitamin C-deficient mice. However, vitamin C-deficient male mice
      had a higher lung viral titer when infected with the more virulent influenza A/PR8/34 compared
      with vitamin C-adequate mice. This difference was not found in the female vitamin C-deficient
      mice. In addition, the Se- and vitamin C-deficient mice had an altered immune response to
      influenza virus infection. Although vitamin C deficiency increased lung pathology late post
      infection in both male and female gulo-/- mice, there was a clear sex difference in the effect
      of vitamin C deficiency on the immune response, as the difference in the expression of
      chemokines and cytokines was only observed in male vitamin C-deficient mice. This study
      demonstrated that a deficiency in either Se or vitamin C can alter the immune response to
      influenza virus infection, resulting in altered lung pathology. In addition, the sex
      differences found in the vitamin C-deficient mice suggest a further complexity in the response
      of the host to antioxidant nutrient deprivation. Clearly, an adequate Se and vitamin C intake
      is essential for a healthy immune response against infectious disease and other antioxidants
      cannot fully compensate for their deficiency.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) activates long chain fatty acids in the initial
      step of lipid metabolism, and provides substrates for both anabolic and catabolic pathways.
      Dysregulation of fatty acid partitioning between these opposing pathways results in cellular
      lipid accumulation, which may cause obesity and lipotoxicity. We hypothesized that ACSL
      isoforms play a critical role in fatty acid channeling into different metabolic pathways and
      that regulation of ACSL may change the fatty acid channeling. This dissertation describes
      three independent projects that examined the function of rat ACSL isoforms in lipid metabolism
      and their acute regulation by phosphorylation. Using an E. coli model with its endogenous ACSL
      mutated (fadD), we demonstrated that although all rat ACSL isoforms partially rescued fatty
      acid transport, beta-oxidation, and phospholipid synthesis, only ACSL5 supported growth on
      oleate as the sole energy and carbon source. This study supported the hypothesis that ACSL
      isoforms are functionally different and prompted the subsequent study on function of ACSL1 in
      lipid metabolism. Using an adenovirus that carries an ACSL1 cDNA, we overexpressed rat ACSL1
      in primary hepatocytes and examined the effects on metabolic pathways. Consistent with our
      hypothesis that individual ACSLs partition fatty acid, we found that ACSL1 overexpression
      increased oleate incorporation into diacylglycerol and phospholipids, but not triacylglycerol,
      and decreased cholesterol ester synthesis. Together with the finding from a previous study in
      our lab with ACSL5 overexpression, these data provided direct evidence of different fatty acid
      channeling by ACSLs. We then studied the potential acute phosphorylation regulation of ACSL1
      and ACSL5 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and hepatocytes. We identified phosphorylated threonine 192 on
      ACSL5, and detected ACSL5 and ACSL1 with phosphorylated serine residues. These data were the
      first to show that ACSL could be phosphorylated, and that phosphorylation could occur on
      distinct residues among different ACSL isoforms. The importance of this dissertation also lies
      in directing future research on mechanisms of specific role of individual ACSL isoforms and
      potential clinical implication for obesity and its related metabolic diseases.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>CFTR-delta-F508 exhibits a correctable protein-folding defect. Protein Quality Control
      components identify and degrade proteins such as CFTR-delta-F508 that fail to acquire a native
      conformation. Loss of CFTR activity results in improper lung mucosa hydration and causes
      cystic fibrosis. Components that function in the CFTR biogenic pathway have been identified.
      However, to more fully understand the folding defect and to identify the biogenic intermediate
      that is selected for degradation it is necessary to identify the Quality Control components
      responsible for CFTR-delta-F508 degradation. Herein we identify two novel multi-subunit E3
      Ubiquitin Ligase complexes: the cytosolic Hsc70/CHIP/UbcH5a complex, and the ER localized
      Derlin-1/RMA1/Ubc6e complex. Inactivation of the Hsc70/CHIP/UbcH5a complex using a mutant
      dominant negative form of UbcH5a has led to the identification of a CFTR-delta-F508 biogenic
      intermediate that can acquire a detergent soluble stable interaction with molecular chaperones
      and upon exposure to 26 degrees C, can fold and be expressed at the plasma membrane (PM).
      Studies utilizing both the Hsc70/CHIP/UbcH5a complex and the Derlin-1/RMA1/Ubc6e complex to
      comparatively study the sensitivity of CFTR biogenic intermediates to each quality control
      component has led to the finding that the kinetically trapped folding intermediate caused by
      the delta-F508 mutation is identified by the Derlin-1/RMA1/Ubc6e complex early in the biogenic
      process. Thus, these studies have been instrumental in the discovery of two sequential Quality
      Control checkpoints that function to target CFTR-delta-F508 for proteasomal degradation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The feedback loop is a ubiquitous regulatory motif that allows biological systems to
      dynamically control the intensity, duration and specificity of signal transduction. In yeast
      there are three interconnected mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction
      pathways controlling the mating pheromone response, the invasive growth response and the high
      osmolarity glycerol (HOG) response respectively. These parallel signaling pathways involve
      distinct MAPKs although they share some upstream components. Here we studied feedback
      regulation in each of these three yeast signal transduction pathways with the combinatorial
      use of experimental and computational analysis. We identified a novel negative feedback loop
      in the yeast pheromone pathway and a novel negative feedback loop in the yeast high osmolarity
      glycerol (HOG) response pathway, both of which contribute to regulation of signal intensity
      and duration. The feedback loop we identified in the pheromone pathway involves
      pheromone-dependent transcriptional induction of a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS)
      protein, Sst2, that accelerates GTPase activity of the G protein and contributes to signal
      termination. The feedback loop we discovered in the HOG response pathway is mediated by
      feedback phosphorylation of the osmotic sensor Sho1 by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
      Hog1. Both of these two feedback regulations lead to signal desensitization. We also found a
      novel feedback loop that contributes to control the signal specificity between the pheromone
      pathway and the invasive growth pathway. The pheromone and invasive growth pathways require
      distinct effector MAP kinases (Fus3 and Kss1, respectively) yet they are activated by a common
      set of upstream kinases (Ste11 and Ste7). We found that phosphorylation of an intermediary MAP
      kinase kinase (Ste7) by Fus3 leads to selective inhibition of Kss1 and thus prevents
      cross-activation of the invasive growth pathway by pheromone. The analysis of feedback
      regulation in yeast might provide insights into the mechanism of signal desensitization and
      signal specificity control in higher eukaryotic organisms. The combination of experimental and
      computational approaches employed in our study could also be applied to other signaling
      pathways and other organisms, and promises to improve our understanding of how cellular
      changes in disease states can be predicted and managed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study examines the lower extremity biomechanics, kinematics and kinetics during
      cutting maneuvers performed by recreational athletes by comparing the effects of anticipation,
      gender and training on the biomechanics of the cutting maneuver. Ankle, knee and hip injuries
      are thought to most likely to occur when performing such cutting maneuver. Understanding the
      dynamics of motions during cutting is the first step to prevent such injuries. Previous
      studies have compared the cutting maneuver to a straight-ahead run, however a more typical
      situation is an abrupt unanticipated change of direction. The hypothesis of this study is that
      decreasing the time between when an athlete is given a signal to the direction of a cutting
      maneuver and the performance of that cutting maneuver changes the motion dynamic which would
      lead to the increased risk of injury, specifically at the knee. Thirty-three recreational
      athletes (16 women and 17 men) participated in this study. Each of the subjects performed the
      three timing conditions (preplanned, planned and unplanned) for cutting in both the left and
      right directions and the straight-ahead run. A total of 46 dependent variables were examined
      for this study including: peak moments and angles at the ankle, knee and hip joints along with
      GRF, and trunk movement. There were significant difference found between the cutting maneuver
      compared to the straight-ahead run at the ankle, knee and hip joints. For the timing condition
      only the trunk rotation was found to be significantly different between unplanned and
      preplanned timing conditions for both the left and right cutting maneuvers (p&lt;.005).
      Leg dominance significantly effected moments at the ankle and knee joints. The non-dominant
      leg was found to be potentially more susceptible to injury than the dominant leg. A
      significant difference in hip movement between men and women was identified with women showing
      more hip adduction than men (p&lt;.039). Experience or training was found to have a
      significant effect on maximum dorsiflexion angle with the less experienced subjects having
      larger dorsiflexion angles.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The main objective of this study was to examine the potential for a host of contextual
      factors at multiple levels (including season, natural resource responsibility, women's status,
      and service accessibility) to affect contraceptive behavior and fertility in the Western
      Chitwan Valley of Nepal. This question was addressed using data from the Chitwan Valley Family
      Study, a long running and data intensive data collection effort based at the Population
      Studies Center at the University of Michigan. This dissertation found evidence to support the
      hypothesis that unmet need for contraception and past contraceptive discontinuation are both
      significantly related to and interact to affect future fertility and contraceptive behavior.
      It was also found that there were seasonal patterns in contraceptive use in the Western
      Chitwan Valley, suggesting that the monsoon was a particularly vulnerable time for potential
      and actual contraceptive users. Finally this research concludes that women's status, natural
      resource responsibility, and accessibility of services have the potential to interact to
      affect contraceptive behavior. Overall it can be concluded from this dissertation research
      that contextual factors directly affect and interact to affect contraceptive behavior. This
      research demonstrates that multiple factors have the potential to interact both within (such
      as individual unmet need and contraceptive histories) and across (such as season and natural
      resource responsibility) levels of contextual hierarchies to influence contraceptive use
      dynamics. This more thorough contextual understanding of contraceptive behavior in Nepal
      provides insights into some of the barriers to contraceptive use in this setting, such as
      seasonal disruption in contraceptive use, which have never before been examined. This
      dissertation also represents a wider and more unique line of inquiry into the broader
      contextual influences on behavior than is currently represented in the literature on
      contraceptive use dynamics.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Background: Pertussis is increasingly recognized as a public health concern among
      infants too young to be vaccinated despite widespread vaccination. Valid estimates of who
      infects young infants with Bordetella pertussis are unavailable because previous studies did
      not identify source cases for 47% to 60% of infant cases. Furthermore, the proportion of
      transmission due to casual contact among those with unidentified sources remains unknown.
      Methods: A prospective multi-center study was conducted of laboratory confirmed infant
      pertussis cases (aged ? 6 months) and their close contacts in France, Germany, the U.S. and
      Canada from February 2003 through September 2004. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation was
      performed on all participants independent of symptoms. Complete case and multiple imputation
      (MI) analyses were used to address missing data among participants and non-participants.
      Source cases were identified and described by relationship to the infant, age, and household
      status. Results: The study population comprised 95 index cases and 460 contacts. The source of
      pertussis was identified for 66% and 69% of infants using MI and the complete case analysis,
      respectively. In the primary analysis, parents accounted for 55% of source cases, followed by
      siblings (16%), aunts/uncles (10%), friends/cousins (10%), grandparents (6%), and part-time
      caretakers (2%). The estimated distribution of source cases with close contact was robust to
      changes in the source case definition in sensitivity analyses. However, the proportion of
      transmission due to casual community contact was sensitive to changes in the incubation and
      infectious periods used in the source case definition, and sensitive to allowing transmission
      from those with asymptomatic laboratory confirmed infection, resulting in estimates ranging
      from 20% to 48%. Discussion: This study provides evidence that among infants for whom a source
      case was identified, household members were responsible for 76% to 83% of transmission of B.
      pertussis to this high-risk group. Also, transmission from casual community contact accounts
      for an appreciable proportion of transmission to young infants. Vaccinating adolescents and
      adults with close contact to infants may be an important strategy in reducing the incidence of
      infant pertussis if high coverage rates can be achieved.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Sediment and nutrient fluxes resulting from dam removal were investigated with a
      combination of field and laboratory studies. Impoundment-specific controls (i.e., regional,
      structural, biological and hydrogeomorphic) on loadings of dissolved organic carbon (DOC),
      inorganic and organic nitrogen and total suspended solids (TSS) were investigated. In
      particular, impoundment source areas (channel as well as floodplain wetlands) were compared to
      determine which represents a greater source of TSS, DOC and TDN to downstream environments. To
      determine if nutrient-rich sediments released from former impoundments continue to contribute
      C, N and P to the water column during downstream routing, a series of controlled laboratory
      experiments were performed. Sediment suspensions - at concentrations similar to those seen
      during dam removals - were exposed to simulated solar radiation, while DOC, total dissolved
      nitrogen (TDN), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and
      CO2 concentrations were measured before and after exposure. Additionally, the ability of
      successional plant community to sequester or otherwise immobilize interstitial N and P pools
      within formerly impounded sediment accumulations exposed by dam removal was investigated.
      Finally, based on the experience and knowledge gained from this dissertation, a conceptual
      model of upstream and downstream disturbances resulting from dam removal was constructed. It
      is hoped that this dissertation will serve the shared interests among basic river researchers,
      river restoration practitioners, policy makers and aquatic resources regulators.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>A relative deficiency of choline and betaine has been studied for its potential
      atherogenic properties, which appears to be secondary to the aberrant methylation process that
      it induces. It is now possible to conduct studies of choline and betaine because the
      concentrations of choline in common foods have been relatively well characterized. The
      relative risk of a low dietary intake of choline and betaine in relation with incident
      coronary heart disease (CHD) was investigated by gender, race and menopausal status in a
      middle-aged biracial cohort of 14,430 men and women sampled from four U.S. locales by the
      Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. During the 14 years of follow-up of this
      large prospective cohort, there was not a significant association between dietary intake of
      choline (or choline plus betaine) and the risk of incident CHD. Compared with the lowest
      quartile of intake, incident CHD risk was 22% higher [HR = 1.22 (0.91, 1.64)] and 14% higher
      [HR = 1.14 (0.85, 1.53)] in the highest quartile of choline and choline plus betaine,
      respectively, controlling for age, gender, education, total energy intake, and dietary intakes
      of folate, methionine and vitamin B6. Correction for measurement error in the dietary intake
      of choline and related nutrients provided similar results. The hazard ratio for an
      interquartile difference of choline and betaine intake was 1.24 (0.92, 1.66), when the
      covariates considered to be measured without error were age and gender. The reliability of the
      dietary assessment for choline and betaine as assessed with a brief semi-quantitative food
      frequency questionnaire was ascertained and the ARIC population intakes of dietary choline and
      betaine were estimated. The reliability coefficients were in the same range as those reported
      for other micronutrients (0.50 for choline). The median and the 25th percentile of dietary
      choline intake in the ARIC population were 284 mg/day and 215 mg/day, respectively. The intake
      of choline was below that proposed as the Adequate Intake for 94% of men and 89% of women.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Small knee flexion angles at initial contact and large ground reaction forces during
      landing have been identified as risk factors for non-contact anterior cruciate ligament
      injuries that are common in sports. This study investigated the effects of knee extension
      constraint on knee flexion angle and ground reaction forces for patients who were 4-6 months
      post ACL reconstruction surgery, and also compared these patients to healthy subjects' motion
      patterns. Three-dimensional videographic and force plate data were collected for 12 ACL
      reconstruction patients and 12 age and gender matched healthy subjects performing level
      walking, jogging, and stair descending under 3 conditions: knee brace with a constraint to
      extension, traditional knee brace, and no knee brace. The constrained knee brace significantly
      increased knee flexion angle at landing, but did not significantly affect the peak ground
      reaction forces at landing. The constrained knee brace may be useful in the prevention and
      rehabilitation of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injuries in sports.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Decision support systems (DSS) are often employed in complex environmental problems to
      provide the user with an integrated solution approach and can range from purely qualitative to
      quantitative modeling to fully automated. This paper presents a semiquantitative DSS approach
      for the problem of microbial loading in surface waters due to stormwater runoff. Six important
      stormwater variables are identified within the Neuse River Basin, N.C. Linear regression is
      used to assess the correlation of each variable with measured fecal coliform levels in surface
      waters. The resultant DSS provides a relative ranking of each variable based on its predictive
      value and a scaling based on its dynamic range. The DSS presented provides a less complex,
      less resource intensive approach to the problem posed than other available stormwater modeling
      programs, but also provides a more reliable estimate of risk than a purely qualitative DSS.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This research examines how key household water and sanitation indicators can predict
      poverty using data from a Kathmandu household survey. I found that water and sanitation
      indicators were able to correctly identify 68% of households using a strict poverty standard
      developed from income, expenditure, and asset data, and 73% of households using a similar but
      slightly less strict poverty standard. Adding a household indicator (the type of cooking fuel
      used by the household) to the water and sanitation indicators increased the amount of
      correctly assessed households to 73% with the strict standard and 77% with the less strict
      standard. I also examine the affect water and sanitation indicators have on the ability of
      asset indices to predict poverty. I found that the addition of two water and sanitation
      indicators to the asset index did not increase its ability to predict poverty based on income
      and expenditure data.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Engagement in occupation and the experienced meaning of that occupation are
      interdependent and mutually transforming (Hasselkus, 2002). Therefore, changes in meaning are
      central to the development of occupation. However, few studies explore the occupational
      meanings experienced by young children. This observational study, set in a childcare center,
      explores the meaning of mealtime occupations of toddlers (age 13 to 24 months). A
      phenomenological method was used to identify and describe the various meanings of mealtime as
      experienced by toddlers. Five occupational meanings emerged from the data: satiating hunger,
      enjoying, adults as guides, being similar, and violation of expectations. Each of these
      meanings is discussed in terms of its impact on occupation both generally and in regards to
      learning to use the spoon. Finally, these meanings are discussed in terms of the Processes
      Transforming Occupation (PTO) model; considering the model's relevance to independent
      observations of occupational meaning.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of Local Computed Tomography
      (LCT) for the detection of longitudinal fractures and to determine the effect of the number of
      basis images on the detection accuracy. In Part I, 10 observers' evaluated LCT image volumes
      generated with 180 basis images of fractured and non-fractured teeth. These were compared with
      conventional radiographs to assess the accuracy in detecting longitudinal fractures. Part II
      evaluated the effect of the number of basis images on the detection of longitudinal fractures.
      180, 60, 36 and 20 basis images were tested. This study demonstrated that LCT provided a
      significant improvement in the accuracy of detecting longitudinal fractures compared to
      periapical radiographs. LCT maintains its efficacy for detecting longitudinal fractures with
      60 instead of 180 basis images. A subsequent reduction to 36 basis images significantly
      reduced the detection rate.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Urban growth and economic development have fueled concerns over meeting future water
      supply needs. Water transfers offer one method of addressing the growing scarcity by
      moderating the temporal and spatial inequities in water supply. Effective management of water
      transfers among inter-connected utilities requires well developed rules describing when and
      how much water will be transferred. The nature of the decision rules (e.g. agreement terms)
      used to manage water transfers impacts the amount of water transferred and capacity of the
      treatment and conveyance infrastructure required to execute the transfers. This study uses
      simulation to identify infrastructure-agreement combinations that provide high reliability at
      low cost. Three agreement types are evaluated: Take-or-Pay, Days of Supply Remaining (DSR),
      and Risk-of-Failure (ROF). Results show the DSR and ROF agreements reduce the volume of water
      transferred by nearly 60% and 80%, respectively, and translate into average cost savings of
      41% and 49%, respectively, over Take-or-Pay agreements.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Reducing the need for harvesting autologous bone is a major goal of current research.
      A recently developed collagen/dextran hygrogel scaffold (E-matrixTM) may offer osteoinductive
      advantages as a biologic polymer for bone repair. This scaffold, by mimicking embryonic
      extracellular matrix, could promote osteogenesis in the absence of osseoinductive agents.
      8.9mm craniotomy defects were created in the parietal bone of 23 Sprague-Dawley rats. In a
      randomized manner, implants (Collagen only, Collagen/E matrix, Collagen/BMP) were placed onto
      the defect. Healing was permitted for 2, 4 or 6 weeks. At these timelines BMP treated defects
      showed good bone repair (26.20%, 42.60% and 22.12% bone fill, respectively). EmatrixTM defects
      showed equal bone repair at 4 and 6 weeks (40.21 and 22.12% respectively), but reduced bone at
      2 weeks (5.08%). Bone repair was incomplete in Collage and saline treated defects. EmatrixTM
      supported bone repair of critical sized defects. The mechanism of action requires additional
      investigation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Limited provider participation in the Medicaid program is a barrier to access to
      orthodontic care for Medicaid-eligible patients. Questionnaires were mailed to all active
      orthodontists (n=203) reported by the NC Health Professions Data System. Respondents were
      categorized as current Medicaid providers, past Medicaid providers, or orthodontists who have
      never accepted Medicaid. Of the 166 respondents, 24% were current Medicaid providers, 20% past
      providers, and 56% never accepted Medicaid patients. Provider and practice characteristics of
      the three groups were similar. All three groups reported low fee reimbursement as a major
      problem. Those who have never participated in the Medicaid program were more likely to
      perceive program issues and patient behaviors as major problems than current or past
      providers. Past providers perceived broken appointments and tardiness to appointments as more
      of a problem than current providers. Perceptions of Medicaid patients and lack of knowledge
      appear to be major barriers to provider participation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Many high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are known or
      suspected carcinogens and as ubiquitous environmental pollutants, their remediation is
      necessary to reduce human and environmental health risk. Since PAH are biodegradable,
      bioremediation offers potential for site clean-up. Bioremediation techniques include in situ
      methods, or excavation followed by reactor treatment. To determine whether bacterial community
      diversity depends on treatment method, two incubation conditions were examined by stable
      isotope probing of pyrene-degrading bacteria in an aged PAHcontaminated soil. Microcosms of
      continuously mixed soil slurry or static, field-wet soil were spiked with [U-13C] pyrene and
      incubated in the dark at room temperature for 28 days. Recovered 13C-enriched DNA was analyzed
      by denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. The
      minimal diversity observed between DGGE profiles suggests that pyrene-degrading bacterial
      community diversity may be independent of treatment method, though slurry libraries were
      slightly more diverse than field wet libraries.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Dental caries is increasing among low-socio economic children. A demonstration
      project, "Into the Mouths of Babes" (IMB), utilized physicians to prevent
      dental caries in Medicaid-enrolled children. The purpose of this study is to characterize oral
      health knowledge and behaviors among caregivers of Medicaid-enrolled children and to assess
      their association with early childhood caries in these children. A four-paged questionnaire
      with 36 closed and open-ended questions was administered to parents of children who were
      approximately 1 year of age. The questionnaires were linked with patient encounter forms. Data
      were analyzed descriptively and bivariately using SAS. The 549 caregivers included in this
      study had a high level of dental knowledge and importance about most areas of oral health.
      Inappropriate bottle use and age were strong predictors of ECC. Studies should continue on the
      effectiveness of counseling caregivers and promoting healthy dental behaviors that improve the
      oral health of children enrolled in Medicaid.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Some mass media scholars have argued that U.S. news coverage of Afghan women after
      September 11 helped the Bush administration define its 2001 invasion of Afghanistan as a
      humanitarian mission. Building on this research, I performed a feminist rhetorical analysis of
      Time's December 3, 2001, cover story, which promised to deliver "an inside
      look" at Afghan women's lives. Ironically, the article, "About
      Face," created an Orientalist distance between readers and Afghan women by
      constructing the women as objects of the readers' Westernized, masculinized gaze. Furthermore,
      in casting women as passive victims, the article upheld disempowering ideologies about women
      and legitimized the war as a rescue mission. In one exception to the victim portrayal, Afghan
      mothers were cast as brave, determined protectors of their children. Although the
      "determined mother" portrayal confounded the victim archetype, it still
      followed the gendered logic of wartime reporting, which confines female agency to the domestic
      realm.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The HOPE VI public housing redevelopment program has funded the demolition of many
      distressed public housing units across the United States, along with the construction of new
      developments which incorporate public housing with market-rate housing. Among the primary
      goals of this program is the improvement of the safety and security of the public housing
      residents as well as their non-public housing neighbors. One such HOPE VI project replaced the
      Few Gardens public housing community in Durham, NC with an array of mixedincome housing
      scattered throughout a 96 block area just east of downtown. Using univariate statistical
      techniques implemented through a geographical information system (GIS), along with local
      statistics of spatial clustering, this study examines how the spatial distribution of violent
      crime changed both in the area around the demolished complex and in the city as a whole during
      the time period in which the project was executed. While the HOPE VI area remained one of the
      more dangerous parts of the city, violent crime in the neighborhood declined precipitously
      between 2002 and 2004. At the same time, however, violent crime increased in several other
      pockets of the city, including some areas where large numbers of former Few Gardens residents
      relocated. These results illustrate HOPE VI's capacity for positive change, but also troubling
      trends in which disorganization and inequality may be replicated elsewhere in the city.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>We fix three natural numbers k, n,N, such that n + k + 1 = N, and introduce the notion
      of two dual arrangements of hyperplanes. One of the arrangements is an arrangement of N
      hyperplanes in a k-dimensional affine space, the other is an arrangement of N hyperplanes in
      an n-dimensional affine space. We assign weights alpha 1, . . . , alpha N to the hyperplanes
      of the arrangements and for each of the arrangements consider the associated period matrices.
      The first is a matrix of k-dimensional hypergeometric integrals and the second is a matrix of
      n-dimensional hypergeometric integrals. The size of each matrix is equal to the number of
      bounded domains of the corresponding arrangement. We show that the dual arrangements have the
      same number of bounded domains and the product of the determinants of the period matrices is
      equal to an alternating product of certain values of Euler's gamma function multiplied by a
      product of exponentials of the weights.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The outsourcing of manufacturing resources has been occurring for many years, and is
      increasing in many industries. There exists some well developed theory under the headings of
      "make-buy," "firm boundaries," "economics of
      organization," and "vertical integration." Outsourcing, or the
      turning over of an activity to an outside vendor, is a subset of these vast literature
      streams. In this dissertation, we draw from the manufacturing strategy, economics, and
      business strategy literature to enhance the existing economic theory of outsourcing by
      incorporating an operations strategy lens. Specifically, we look how manufacturing outsourcing
      influences-and is influenced by-a firm's cost and quality capabilities. We do this through
      three separate essays using multiple methods. All three essays arose from an iterative process
      of literature review and practitioner interviews. The essays are related both in their
      grounding in existing literature and theory and in their focus on the relationship between
      manufacturing capabilities and outsourcing decisions and outcomes. In the first essay,
      "The Effect of Learning and Strategic Behavior on Manufacturing Outsourcing
      Decisions," we analytically evaluate how the presence of learning-by-doing and
      strategic behavior by both parties affects a major outsourcing decision in a two-period game.
      Previous analytic work that has assessed the effect of learning on outsourcing neglected the
      possibility of opportunism by the supplier. To fill this gap, we analyze a two-period game
      involving a firm that has the opportunity to outsource some portion iii of its volume to a
      contract manufacturer. Both firms can reduce their production cost through learning-by-doing.
      When the contract manufacturer is the Stackelberg leader, we obtain several interesting
      results. These include showing that the contract manufacturer's learning can benefit the
      buying firm, but only if the buying firm also learns. We also show that learning by the buying
      firm can either help or hurt the contract manufacturer. In addition, we find that below-cost
      transfer pricing by the contract manufacturer will occur. We also analyze alternative
      bargaining arrangements. This essay analytically shows the importance of considering both
      learning-by-doing and possible future opportunism when deciding whether or not to outsource.
      In the second essay, "Outsourcing of Manufacturing Resources: The Effect of
      Manufacturing Capabilities and Priorities" we empirically analyze relationships
      between operations capabilities and priorities (quality and cost) and a firm's plans to
      outsource. This essay extends the existing research on antecedents of outsourcing in two ways.
      First, we make theoretical arguments about specifically which firm-specific operations
      capabilities and priorities relate to plans to outsource. This is different from the extant
      literature which looks at a single capability proxy, if capabilities are considered at all.
      Second, we develop operational metrics and test the hypotheses using structural equation
      modeling. We find, as expected, that cost capability and importance impact outsourcing plans.
      Surprisingly, we find that quality capability and importance do not matter. The third essay is
      entitled "Buyer Beware? Quality Risk in Manufacturing Outsourcing." Here,
      linked to the second essay, we examine whether quality capability and importance should relate
      to outsourcing plans. We draw from literature in supply chain management, total quality
      management, and economics to argue that outsourcing proiv duction to contract manufacturers
      does pose a quality risk. We draw from similar literature to also propose that ISO 9000 does
      little to mitigate this risk. We use eleven years of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      inspection results from the United States drug industry as a proxy for quality risk. We
      interview a panel of industry experts using the Delphi process to transform the raw data to a
      usable "quality risk" score. After classifying 154 plants from the database
      as either "contract manufacturer" or "internal plant," we
      use ordered logit regression on our quality risk score to show that outsourcing to contract
      manufacturers does pose a quality risk; and that being ISO 9000 certified does not alter a
      firm's quality risk.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The solution properties of a fluorinated alkyl methacrylate, poly(1,1,2,2-tetrahydro
      perfluorooctyl methacrylate) (PFOMA) in carbon dioxide (CO2) were studied by static and
      dynamic light scattering. The solvent quality of CO2 was found to improve with increasing
      temperature and CO2 density as exhibited by an increase of the second virial coefficient. Both
      the hydrodynamic radius expansion factor and the second virial coefficient of PFOMA solution
      were found to be functions of a single interaction parameter that can be independently changed
      by either temperature or density variations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the relationship
      between two directly measurable quantities, the second virial coefficient and the hydrodynamic
      expansion ratio, is the same for both temperatureinduced and CO2 density-induced variations of
      solvent quality. The degradation of coating materials that contain long perfluoro chains leads
      to the release of biopersistent perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) into the environment. In order
      to find environmentally friendly substitutes, a series of fluorinated alkyl methacrylate
      polymers containing the shorter and non-biopersistant perfluorobutyl group as the fluorinated
      component of the side chains are synthesized starting from perfuorobutyl iodide. Thermal
      properties of the polymers were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and
      differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Static and dynamic contact angle measurements were
      used to quantify the surface properties of the thin films for these new non-biopersistant
      materials (C4 materials). The surface construction, especial the orientation of the
      fluorinated side chains, were recorded by near edge X-ray fine absorption structure (NEXAFS)
      experiments. In all, C4 materials displayed the hydrophobic and oleophobic properties with low
      surfaces tensions and their wetting properties were tuned by varying the
      "spacer" structures between the backbones and the perfluorinated groups of
      the side chains.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Rare-earth hexaborides are a family of compounds which have low work function, high
      melting point, and high mechanical strength. These properties are highly suitable for electron
      field emission applications. To explore this possibility, we developed a chemical vapor
      deposition method and produced three different types of 1D nano-structures, which include
      single crystalline nanowires of LaB6, CeB6, and GdB6; polycrystalline nanowires of YB12,
      LaB12, MgO, and Mg3N2; core-shell nanocables of MgB2-in-MgO and LaB6-in-CNT. TEM, SEM, EELS
      and EDX techniques were applied to characterize structural and chemical information about the
      synthesized nano-structures. Vapor-solid growth, catalyst-assisted vapor-liquid-solid growth
      and CNT-assisted template growth are proposed to be accounted for the formation mechanisms of
      these 1D nano-structures and the theoretical predictions match the experimental observations
      quantitatively. To fabricate a single nanowire field emitter, direct contact, electron beam
      lithography and focused ion beam welding techniques were used to attach a single LaB6 nanowire
      to the tip of a tungsten wire. Cold field emission properties were measured from such made
      single nanowire emitters. Work function values of 2.6 eV and 1.5 eV were obtained from a LaB6
      nanowire emitter and GdB6 nanowire emitter respectively. An Emission Current density as high
      as 5×105 A/cm2 was obtained from a single LaB6 nanowire emitter, under an extraction voltage
      of 800 V. Emission current stability was also studied for the nanowire emitter and the results
      indicate surface-contamination induced emission current fluctuations. A home-designed TEM
      in-situ field emission measurement holder was fabricated for a JEOL 2010F HRTEM. Field
      electron emission was performed on a single LaB6 nanowire field electron emitter
      simultaneously with high resolution TEM imaging. Image contrast changes were observed at
      under-focus imaging conditions when a series of negative biases were applied to the nanowire
      emitter. Such contrast changes can be used to qualitatively image the charge density
      distribution on the nanowire emitter tip during field electron emission.</mods:abstract>

               </mods:language>
               <mods:abstract>From 1988 through 2006, the United States closed nearly two dozen large military sites
      and reclassified them to become national wildlife refuges. In this dissertation I examine the
      production of these places, covering more than one million acres of land and marine territory,
      as they have been represented through political and scientific discourses. In particular, I
      consider the implications of "ecological militarization," which casts
      military practices and environmental conservation as compatible activities.
      Military-to-wildlife (M2W) conversions include some of the nation's worst sites of
      contamination and most protected ecological habitat. The seeming paradox of these lands
      creates challenges to wildlife managers and other federal officials as historically restricted
      military places open to new kinds of public attention and use. The purpose of my research is
      to examine military-to-wildlife conversions through two main questions: How have these
      particular landscapes been produced, and how do they then function as public lands? I approach
      the first of these research questions by asking how M2W sites have been cast by politics,
      science, and certain narratives to effect their conversion. Second, I assess how these places
      work as integrations of nature and society to function as new national wildlife refuges, as
      former military lands, and as new geographies where projects of militarism and
      environmentalism appear to coincide as complementary endeavors. I apply methods of document
      and discourse analysis, as well as semi-structured interviews and site visits, to focus on two
      case studies: the Rocky Mountain Arsenal in Colorado, and the Big Oaks National Wildlife
      Refuge in southeastern Indiana. These present different details of contamination, remediation,
      legislation, and public use, but highlight common themes of institutional control, science and
      technology, and discourse. I conclude that military-to-wildlife conversions and the broader
      framing of ecological militarization will only contribute to genuine social change, democratic
      politics, and environmental protection if they are linked to new roles for science and
      technology, a transfer of institutional control, the publicizing and preservation of M2W
      landscape productions, and attentiveness to impacts beyond the boundaries of base closure
      sites.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This qualitative study investigated the practices and beliefs of parents and teachers
      with regard to the support of reciprocal friendship dyads including one child with special
      needs (SN) and one typically developing (TD) child. The study addressed the following research
      questions through interviews completed by parents and teachers of preschool age children: (a)
      How do parents and teachers describe the nature and importance of the friendship between the
      SN child and the TD child? (b) What strategies do parents and teachers use to facilitate the
      SN-TD friendship, and what factors affect their use of these strategies? (c) What are the
      similarities and differences between parents' and teachers' beliefs and practices regarding
      the support of SN-TD friendships? and (d) What types of communication - if any - occur between
      parents and teachers about these friendships? Parents and teachers reported holding similar
      beliefs about the nature and importance of friendships, describing most of these preschool
      friendships as harmonious: characterized by children showing affection, playing well together,
      wanting to be together, talking about each other, having commonalities (e.g., similar
      interests), and being compatible (e.g., met each others' needs). The majority of parents and
      teachers believed specific friendships between two children were important because of the
      emotional benefits they provided children. Parents and teachers reported using a variety of
      strategies to help these preschool children become and stay friends, including general
      strategies that set up the social environment such as encouraging children's social skills in
      general, strategies that provided opportunities for the two friends to play together such as
      assigning friends to the same center or arranging playdates, and strategies that helped the
      friends interact and play with each other such as helping the friends resolve conflicts. Most
      parents and teachers communicated with each other through informal conversation (and preferred
      to communicate informally) on a variety of topics relating to specific friendships and most
      reported being satisfied with this parentteacher communication. Implications for practice
      include increasing parent and teacher awareness of the importance of friendship and strategies
      for promoting friendship.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The ability to extract rate constants and dissociation energies of parallel and
      sequential dissociation pathways in energy selected ions has been made possible by recent
      advances in threshold photoelectron photoion coincidence (TPEPICO) spectrometry. The
      incorporation of velocity focusing optics for improved instrument resolution, the ability to
      subtract the energetic electron contamination in the threshold signal and a more robust
      modeling program are the key components in allowing higher energy reactions to be probed. In
      addition, the recent advances in computational chemistry have allowed the experimental results
      to be supported quickly and accurately. In many cases it has been used to uncover reaction
      mechanisms that would otherwise remain hidden. The work in this thesis is devoted to obtaining
      kinetic and thermochemical information from higher energy dissociation pathways. Both parallel
      and sequential reactions are discussed. The broad range molecules for which this technique can
      be applied makes it both useful and attractive. Chapter 1 is an introduction to the work
      presented, dealing with the motivation and methods of obtaining thermochemical properties of
      molecules. Chapter 2 is the description of the experimental and theoretical methods which are
      applied. A temperature dependant study on the iodine loss in n-butyl iodide ions is described
      in Chapter 3. Modeling this single-step reaction only requires the thermal energy
      distribution, but it provides a useful place to start, since the first step in parallel and
      sequential reactions are treated in the same manner. Chapters 4 and 5 deal with the
      determination of the physical properties of the acetyl ion and radical and well as the
      propionyl ion and radical from parallel dissociations of several energy-selected ketone ions.
      The thermochemsitry of six dihalomethanes of the form CH2XY, where X and Y are any combination
      of Cl, Br, and I are discussed in Chapter 6. In this analysis of parallel reactions, a
      complete thermochemical cycle is established to ensure that the results are self-consistent.
      Chapter 7 deals with the sequential ethane loss channels in a series of energy-selected ethyl
      phosphine ions. The statistical theory of energy-partitioning is used to extract dissociation
      onsets. Chapeter 8 is a study on 2-pentanone, an ion very similar to those studied in chapters
      3 and 4, but one that dissociates in a much more interesting and complex manner. Although only
      3 fragment ions are observed in the TOF distribution, there are 4 parallel and 1 sequential
      dissociation pathway. The ability to model these reactions clearly illustrates the power of
      the TPEPICO technique.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study is to examine the relative importance to managers of pre-tax
      and after-tax earnings. I exploit features of investments in housing tax credits and GAAP
      accounting for those investments. When managers purchase tax credits, accounting rules reduce
      book earnings for the cost of the tax credits through either i) a pre-tax loss, or ii) a tax
      expense. Identically priced tax credit investments result in the same net increase to
      after-tax earnings regardless of the accounting method used. By analyzing the market price of
      tax credits using a confidential database, I find a premium on tax credits that reduce book
      earnings through tax expense, thereby avoiding a reduction to pre-tax earnings. This result
      suggests that managers are willing to sacrifice after-tax earnings, by paying a higher tax
      credit price, to avoid reductions to pre-tax earnings. On average, I estimate that managers
      reduce after-tax earnings by $1 to avoid a reduction to pre-tax earnings of $13. This is the
      first study to my knowledge to suggest that some firm managers place more importance on
      pre-tax earnings than after-tax earnings.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In questions of statistical shape analysis, the foremost is how such shapes should be
      represented. The number of parameters required for a given accuracy and the types of
      deformation they can express directly influence the quality and type of statistical inferences
      one can make. One example is a medial model, which represents a solid object using a skeleton
      of a lower dimension and naturally expresses intuitive changes such as
      "bending", "twisting", and "thickening".
      In this dissertation I develop a new three-dimensional medial model that allows continuous
      interpolation of the medial surface and provides a map back and forth between the boundary and
      its medial axis. It is the first such model to support branching, allowing the representation
      of a much wider class of objects than previously possible using continuous medial methods. A
      measure defined on the medial surface then allows one to write integrals over the boundary and
      the object interior in medial coordinates, enabling the expression of important object
      properties in an object-relative coordinate system. I show how these properties can be used to
      optimize correspondence during model construction. This improved correspondence reduces
      variability due to how the model is parameterized which could potentially mask a true shape
      change effect. Finally, I develop a method for performing global and local hypothesis testing
      between two groups of shapes. This method is capable of handling the nonlinear spaces the
      shapes live in and is well defined even in the high-dimension, low-sample size case. It
      naturally reduces to several well-known statistical tests in the linear and univariate cases.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs) for fuel cells have been synthesized from easily
      processable, 100% curable, low molecular weight reactive liquid precursors that are
      photo-chemically cured into highly proton conductive solid membranes. The liquid precursors
      were directly cured into membranes of desired dimensions without the need for further
      processing steps such as melt extrusion or solvent casting. By employing chemical
      cross-linking, high proton conductivities can be achieved through the incorporation of
      significant levels of acidic groups without rendering the material water soluble, which
      plagues commonly used uncross-linked polymers. Fabrication of membrane electrode assemblies
      (MEAs) from these PEMs resulted in fuel cells that outperformed those based on commercial
      materials. Moreover, these liquid precursors enabled the formation of 3- dimensional,
      patterned PEMs with high fidelity, micron scale features by using soft
      lithographic/micro-molding techniques. The patterned membranes provided larger interfacial
      area between the membrane and catalyst layer than standard flat PEMs. MEAs composed of the
      patterned membranes demonstrated higher power densities over that of flat ones without an
      increase in the geometric volume of the fuel cells. This can potentially miniaturize fuel
      cells and promote their application in portable devices.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Exploiting the availability of panel data, the first paper examines the trends in
      child malnutrition in China, both across cohorts and within cohorts. Descriptive analyses and
      the results of pooled OLS and probit models provide evidence of a dramatic downward secular
      trend in underweight, stunting and wasting. While the aggregate picture is overwhelmingly
      positive, disaggregation of the data by subgroup reveals some disturbing trends: urban-rural,
      gender and provincial disparities in nutritional status have increased over time; gains appear
      to have slowed; and, in some provinces, the prevalence of stunting appears to be increasing.
      The second paper explores the robustness of the estimated effect of economic status on child
      nutritional status to alternative income and assets constructs. The internal and external
      performance of three income measures and eleven asset indices is examined. Then, a series of
      reduced-form child health demand models, in which these constructs enter the models as
      income/asset quintiles, is estimated. The analysis reveals that the choice of construct -
      income or assets - affects results. Further, it provides an indication of the potential
      direction of bias if one class of measures is chosen over another: income measures tend to
      produce smaller coefficients than asset measures, but coefficients are more likely to increase
      progressively, and significantly, with each successive quintile. The third paper explores the
      role of income as a determinant of child nutritional status in China, and examines how its
      effect has been mediated by the one-child policy and changes in the accessibility, cost and
      quality of healthcare. Pooled OLS and probit models produce large income coefficients. These
      coefficients shrink when the effects of policies are incorporated into the model, but remain
      significant. Being an only-child, having shorter traveling times to healthcare facilities and
      having access to better quality healthcare are all correlated with improved nutritional
      status. Once community fixed-effects are introduced, however, the effect of income and
      healthcare becomes insignificant. This pattern is reproduced in pooled OLS and fixed-effects
      models in which income is instrumented. In addition, it is shown that the one-child policy and
      healthcare variables are both gender-neutral and income-neutral in their effects on
      nutritional status.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The different patterns of plant species diversity that occur at local to regional
      scales are examined across the southeastern United States. The relationship between the
      species pool (large-scale community diversity) and local species richness is reviewed to
      clarify the species pool concept and set the stage for the analyses that follow. Techniques
      for estimating the species pool are demonstrated using mapped ranges, county records,
      co-occurrence patterns, and the environmental preferences for woody species in the
      southeastern United States. Species pool estimates for sites across the region are then
      compared to the recorded plant species richness at those sites. Species pools constructed from
      ecological information better predict the patterns of community assembly than pools built from
      phytosociological data. Local versus regional richness assessments and the
      productivity-diversity relationship have been the subject of much debate. Local versus
      regional relationships are investigated for signs of community saturation and resistance to
      plant invasions. Community saturation is not found to be a major structuring force, but the
      dynamic between local and regional richness and species invasion is linked to disturbance
      frequency. The generality of the productivity-diversity relationship is assessed across
      ecologically-distinct plant communities and by using various methods for estimating plant
      productivity. Productivity-diversity relationships are shown to vary with respect to how local
      and landscape assessments of productivity are linked to richness at different scales.
      Collectively, this dissertation draws upon new and old techniques to link ecological processes
      with plant diversity patterns across the southeastern United States. Plant species diversity
      is revealed to be a multi-scalar phenomenon that cannot be fully addressed by local
      interactions alone. A set of tools and guidelines is provided to help researchers study
      complex relationships involving plant diversity dynamics at various scales.</mods:abstract>

      proteins has been the focus of recent e_orts to link structural features found in proteins to
      protein function. In addition, structure patterns have demonstrated values in applications
      such as predicting protein-protein interaction, engineering proteins, and designing novel
      medicines. My thesis introduces graph-based representations of protein structure and new
      subgraph mining algorithms to identify recurring structure patterns common to a set of
      proteins. These techniques enable families of proteins exhibiting similar function to be
      analyzed for structural similarity. Previous approaches to protein local structure pattern
      discovery operate in a pairwise fashion and have prohibitive computational cost when scaled to
      families of proteins. The graph mining strategy is robust in the face of errors in the
      structure, and errors in the set of proteins thought to share a function. Two collaborations
      with domain experts at the UNC School of Pharmacy and the UNC Medical School demonstrate the
      utility of these techniques. The _rst is to predict the function of several newly
      characterized protein structures. The second is to identify conserved structural features in
      evolutionarily related proteins.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Clustering is one of the most effective methods for analyzing datasets that contain a
      large number of objects with numerous attributes. Clustering seeks to identify groups, or
      clusters, of similar objects. In low dimensional space, the similarity between objects is
      often evaluated by summing the difference across all of their attributes. High dimensional
      data, however, may contain irrelevant attributes which mask the existence of clusters. The
      discovery of groups of objects that are highly similar within some subsets of relevant
      attributes becomes an important but challenging task. My thesis focuses on various models and
      algorithms for this task. We first present a flexible clustering model, namely OP-Cluster
      (Order Preserving Cluster). Under this model, two objects are similar on a subset of
      attributes if the values of these two objects induce the same relative ordering of these
      attributes. OPClustering algorithm has demonstrated to be useful to identify co-regulated
      genes in gene expression data. We also propose a semi-supervised approach to discover
      biologically meaningful OP-Clusters by incorporating existing gene function classifications
      into the clustering process. This semi-supervised algorithm yields only OP-clusters that are
      significantly enriched by genes from specific functional categories. Real datasets are often
      noisy. We propose a noise-tolerant clustering algorithm for mining frequently occuring
      itemsets. This algorithm is called approximate frequent itemsets (AFI). Both the theoretical
      and experimental results demonstrate that our AFI mining algorithm has higher recoverability
      of real clusters than any other existing itemset mining approaches. Pair-wise dissimilarities
      are often derived from original data to reduce the complexities of high dimensional data.
      Traditional clustering algorithms taking pair-wise dissimilarities as input often generate
      disjoint clusters from pair-wise dissimilarities. It is well known that the classification
      model represented by disjoint clusters is inconsistent with many real classifications, such
      gene function classifications. We develop a Poclustering algorithm, which generates
      overlapping clusters from pair-wise dissimilarities. We prove that by allowing overlapping
      clusters, Poclustering fully preserves the information of any dissimilarity matrices while
      traditional partitioning algorithms may cause significant information loss.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Chapter One is an introduction to monolayer protected metal clusters (MPCs) as species
      that, because of their small size, bridge the gap between bulk and molecular behavior. The
      method of and variations in their synthesis, as well as their general chemical and
      electrochemical properties, are presented, as are recent examples of their practical
      applications. Chapter Two introduces a new 1-2 nm diameter organic-soluble silver MPC species
      protected by 4-tert-butylbenzyl mercaptan (BBT) ligands and synthesized using two different
      protocols. The BBT ligands impart crucial stability to the small silver cores that otherwise
      is extremely difficult to maintain. MPCs produced with a two-phase protocol exhibit quantized
      double layer (QDL) charging voltammetry and a strong surface plasmon resonance at 475 nm,
      whereas MPCs produced with a one-phase protocol show neither of these features. The difference
      is due to an oxide coating on the one-phase product, observed with XPS. Average stoichiometric
      formulae of Ag140BBT53 and Ag225BBT75 are obtained, for the two most populous core sizes, from
      a combination of thermogravimetric, microscopic, mass spectral, and electrochemical data.
      Chapter Three presents the assembly and characterization of dithiol-linked gold MPC network
      polymer films grown using protocols all based on ligand place-exchange chemistry but differing
      in growth time, growth cycles, and solution preparation. A study of the growth mechanism and
      the rate of growth is also presented. The electronic conductivities, electron transfer rate
      constants, and activation energy barriers were observed to change systematically depending on
      the chain lengths of both the linking (dithiol) and nonlinking (monolayer) ligands, implying
      electronic tunneling through both kinds of ligands. Chapter Four presents the interaction of
      dithiol-linked gold MPC films of different thicknesses with various solvent vapors. Increases
      in film conductivity were observed upon the absorption of both polar and nonpolar vapors,
      implying that the changing of the distance between MPC cores is not the sole mechanism
      occurring in this process. Thinner (27 nm) films are seen to be better suited for the
      detection of low vapor concentrations, and these capabilities are examined with short pulses
      of vapor. Airbrushed gold MPC films are also described in terms of their sensing aspects and
      are observed to respond identically to differing vapor pressures, presumably due to the
      "on/off" tendencies of their electronic pathways upon absorption and
      desorption, respectively. Chapter Five examines the electron transfer kinetics in
      solvent-wetted dithiol-linked gold MPC films in terms of electron diffusion coefficients (De)
      and times-of-flight (tmax) determined using electronic charge and voltage pulses.
      Interdigitated array electrodes were used as generator-collector systems in a four-electrode
      setup, with a pulse generating a flow of electrons at the generator and traveling through the
      film in amounts of time dependent on the magnitude and duration of the pulse. Electron
      transfers were observed to be faster with poorly absorbed solvents, due to less film swelling,
      and were faster overall than those previously seen in various redox polymers and hydrogels.
      Film conductivities were irreversibly increased as a result of the pulses, due to doping of
      the films with electrons/holes.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study was undertaken to augment the limited knowledge of protective factors for
      aggression in rural African American youth. Specifically, this study sought to determine if
      several factors during middle school functioned as buffers against aggressive behavior in high
      school. Aggression is a significant issue facing our educational system. For example, most of
      the aggression youth encounter occurs on school grounds. In addition, engaging in and being
      the recipient of aggressive behavior adversely impacts numerous important educational
      outcomes. One of the most potent risks for aggression is economic deprivation. African
      American youth in rural areas of the South experience severe and persistent poverty, but
      research has rarely involved this population. Studies with rural and African American youth
      have typically incorporated a deficit orientation. As a result, the variation and
      heterogeneity in strengths and risks across these populations has been neglected.
      Personoriented research has demonstrated that cluster analytic procedures can identify unique
      combinations of strengths and risks that capture this variation and also improve prediction of
      developmental outcomes. Consequently, there is a need for studies of resilience that
      incorporate a person-oriented approach and seek to clarify protective factors for aggression
      in rural African American youth. Cluster analyses on teacher-ratings of aggression, academics,
      and popularity were undertaken to identify participants' profiles of risks and strengths at
      the end of elementary school. Youth with multiple risk profiles were identified and were
      considered to be at-risk for future aggression. Results demonstrated that youth with multiple
      risks at the end of elementary school were more aggressive in high school. The factors across
      early adolescence that were examined to determine if these served a protective function were
      involvement in school activities, bonding to school, and involvement in church activities.
      Results indicated that bonding to school served a general protective function for girls while
      involvement in school activities was protective for boys. The significance, strengths and
      limitations, and implications of this study for prevention and intervention efforts are
      discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation presents a theory on how organizational experience affects decisions
      by organizations to enter new product-markets. Facing the choice of new product-markets, a
      firm might decide to introduce a related product, which leverages existing firm knowledge and
      capabilities, or to experiment with a less related product, which requires new knowledge and
      capabilities. Learning and evolutionary theory suggests firms tend to diversify into related
      knowledge areas. Consistent with this view of local search, the first question examined in
      this study is how a firm's technology and market experience affect its productmarket entry
      choice. While local search is considered dominant, it might not be a homogenous process across
      all types of organizations. Organizations at different stages differ in organizational size,
      structure, and cognitive styles. These factors interact with the process of experiential
      learning, leading to divergent learning results. The second question in this study examined
      how experience affects organizations at different stages. Finally, I propose that
      organizational knowledge diversity and organizational access to innovative knowledge are
      concrete examples of dynamic capabilities that might weaken the path-dependency of existing
      technology or market experience, leading to distant product-market entries. The product-market
      entry choices were examined using a model that integrates organizational characteristics with
      organizational learning. The data are on new drug introductions in the generic pharmaceutical
      industry. This dataset covers the whole population of generic pharmaceutical firms in the US
      from 1984-2004, including firms at a variety of ages and stages. The analyses showed clear
      support for the relationship between experience and related product-market entries. And strong
      evidence was found for the heterogeneity of this relationship across organizations. The most
      interesting results are the heterogeneous diversification behavior between new ventures and
      established firms. Compared to established firms (older firms), new ventures (younger firms)
      are more likely to enter related product-markets, and less likely to enter product-markets
      with many competitors. The two organizational features, knowledge diversity and access to
      innovative knowledge, were also found to moderate the relationship between experience and
      product-market entries. Firms with diverse knowledge and access to innovative knowledge are
      less likely to enter related product markets.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The first part of this dissertation is a review of developments made in the field of
      aerosol mass spectrometry. The focus of the research is on the reduction of fragmentation
      observed in the mass spectra of organic molecules and its application to studying the
      reactivity of more realistic aerosol particles. Initial studies examined reduction in oleic
      acid fragmentation with lower energy (8.75 eV) photons generated using resonance difference
      frequency mixing (RDFM), a form of four wave mixing. In the same study, the effects of
      different particle vaporization methods on the ion production mechanism are discussed.
      Understanding both of these issues is very important to accurate kinetics studies. These
      findings were then applied to the study of the reactivity of mixed myristic acid/oleic acid
      particles. While still not as complex as typical atmospheric particles, studying particles
      consisting of a binary mixture, especially the ones studied here which can undergo phase
      changes with changing relative composition is an important first step in understanding issues
      such as why the lifetime of oleic acid as measured in the field is longer than what would be
      predicted from laboratory studies. Our study of mixed particles demonstrates reduced
      reactivity upon crystallization of myristic acid. Possibilities for the way in which
      crystallization would have to occur to result in the observed degree of decreased reactivity
      are also discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important hydrological process that determines North
      Carolina's water availability but has been poorly characterized. Evaluation and calibration of
      the available estimating methods are necessary to achieve a better understanding of ET.
      Investigation of reference evapotranspiration (RET), the rate of ET occurred from a reference
      crop surface that is only influenced by atmospheric conditions, allowed the first
      characterization of the spatio-temporal variations of the evaporative demand for the state.
      RET estimates by the ETgage atmometers at the Environment and Climate Observing Network
      (ECONet) stations were compared with the benchmark Penman-Monteith RET equation established by
      the American Society of Civil Engineers. The analysis suggested a good correlation; however
      the observations were only 80% of the Penman-Monteith values on average. The ETgages were
      insensitive to wind, causing even lower readings than the Penman-Monteith values in windy
      conditions. On rainy days water retention on the evaporating surface also led to greatly
      reduced readings. Linear regression functions were developed for adjusting daily ETgage
      observations to Penman-Monteith equivalent values based on different rainfall amount.
      Investigating the performance of empirical RET equations against the Penman- Monteith equation
      has allowed the development of operational RET equations. The Hargreaves-Samani and solar
      radiation-based regression equations were calibrated to obtain Penman-Monteith equivalent RET
      estimation based on different data availability, land regions and time-steps. The operational
      equations could produce mean absolute error (MAE) of about 20% and 12% in daily and weekly
      time-steps and less than 10% in the monthly time-step. Monthly coefficients for transferring
      reference to potential evapotranspiration were developed for six major land cover types, which
      showed varying regional variations for different surfaces. Analysis of statewide RET indicated
      no secular trend and only weak interannual fluctuations in the past half century. RET peaked
      in June and July and January and December were the least evaporative months. Highest RET
      occurred in the Sandhills region due to its high radiation, temperature and dry atmosphere.
      Lowest RET rates occurred in the Mountains. A statewide southward increasing pattern dominated
      the winters while an inlandcoast decreasing trend was most pronounced in the summers in the
      Coastal Plain.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This quantitative research study explores questions about why and how U.S. daily
      newspapers are adapting as the traditional print medium moves into the revolutionary new realm
      of digitization of content and delivery systems. It explores mass communication theories on
      media technology change and relies on Roger Fidler's (1997) conception of a mediamorphosis, in
      which older media change in order to avoid obsolescence. The study asks how newspapers'
      performance in circulation relates to the their shift toward embracing digital practices,
      specifically a willingness to invite more of a two-way flow of information between journalists
      and audience members. The study looks at a randomly selected sample of 195 daily U.S.
      newspapers with paid circulations of 14,000 or more. The research design involves three
      distinct methodological steps. The first draws upon industry data to calculate newspapers'
      individual performances in maintaining a base of subscribers for their print versions. The
      second applies a content analysis of the Web sites of the sample to explore the extent of
      activity online as newspapers provide opportunities for audience members to participate in the
      creation of content by posting comments and images, a practice unique to the digital
      landscape. The third quantitative step correlates the two data sets to shed light on the
      process of mediamorphosis. The study also inspects the uses of various types of participatory
      features and provides examples from several sites. The data was gathered in 2004 and offers
      both a snapshot of this transitional period as well as baseline information for future
      studies. The study found a slight but statistically significant negative correlation,
      suggesting that as newspapers' performance declined in circulation, organizations were
      shifting to provide more online features that promoted user participation. But few newspaper
      sites were moving quickly. On average, newspapers featured a single kind of structure
      promoting audience response, such as a discussion forum or spaces for comments at the end of
      stories. Trends (such as blogging), new literature, and recent practices indicate that this
      morphing will accelerate in the near future, prompting online editors to adopt more elastic
      forms of professional gatekeeping.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>From Fellowes through Kerman, it has become a commonplace that Byrd was acutely
      sensitive to text and somehow managed to translate that sensitivity into his musical settings.
      In the famous preface to his 1605 Gradualia, Byrd himself hints that sacred texts have the
      power to aid the trained mind in setting them to music. Yet relatively little has been done in
      any systematic way in Byrd scholarship to examine just how his text-setting might operate.
      However, within Byrd's 1589 Cantiones-a collection of Latin sacred songs-lies an array of
      evidence of how he prioritized various musical and extramusical factors in his setting of the
      texts. In my dissertation I begin to uncover this evidence through an examination of four
      compositional tools and concepts available to Byrd: (1) rhetorical commonplaces, musical and
      spiritual; (2) mode; (3) texture; and (4) sonority. While some compositional tools and
      concepts appear to lie almost entirely in the musical realm and bear little impact upon
      text-setting, others play a powerful role in determining textmusic relationships. As I discuss
      in chapter 2, rhetorical figures and a broadly conceived notion of decorum are central to
      text-setting in Byrd's 1589 Cantiones, and they correlate quite powerfully with a broad range
      of musical features that I discuss in more detail later in the dissertation. In chapter 3, I
      tackle the topic of mode and examine the correlations between text and pitch organization as
      manifested by phenomena such as cadences, commixtio, and tessitura. In chapter 4, I examine
      the relationship between text and texture, paying particular attention to counterpoint, voice
      entries, and textural density. In chapter 5, I discuss Byrd's settings from the standpoint of
      text as sonority, considering how Byrd deals with phonemes, syllabic accents, and syntax. And
      in my conclusion, I compare and contrast the various tools and concepts discussed in the body
      of the dissertation along with the evidence they have brought forth in order to propose a
      methodology for analyzing textsetting in Byrd's sacred works.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Aerosol particles have long been a primary focus of the atmospheric community due to
      their influence on human health, radiative forcing, and participation in atmospheric
      chemistry. Conventionally, aerosols have been collected on filters and analyzed off-line by
      GC-MS, LC-MS, and FTIR. These techniques made valuable inroads to particle speciation,
      however, the inherent physical and chemical artifacts during sampling initiated the
      development of a succession of on-line aerosol mass spectrometers. Currently, a variety of
      real-time aerosol mass spectrometers, many with single particle analysis capabilities, have
      been developed and installed in laboratories as well as in the field. Atmospheric aerosols are
      complex mixtures of inorganic and organic species, and whereas analysis of inorganics is
      rather straightforward due to their robust nature, organics are fragile and analysis is
      challenging. Several researchers have moved specifically towards analysis of organic aerosol
      particles, attempting to simplify peak assignment by reducing the fragmentation of these
      delicate molecules. The initial portion of this project involved design and development of an
      aerosol mass spectrometer, ideal for analyzing a wide size range of organic aerosol particles.
      The novel mass spectrometer uses both continuous vaporization with a cartridge heater and
      quasiiv continuous photoionization by tunable vacuum ultraviolet light produced by synchrotron
      radiation. Coupling continuous vaporization and ionization techniques with a high brightness
      photon source allows analysis of ultrafine aerosol particles, which have high toxicity and
      high number concentration in ambient air. Several atmospherically relevant organic molecules
      are examined, along with a more complex yet more realistic secondary organic aerosols formed
      from terpene ozonolysis. Finally, a timing circuit used to analyze single particles (diameter
      &gt; 200nm) was designed and developed. The versatile electronic circuit can be used to
      couple multi-laser systems having pre-triggering requirements to single particle arrival in
      the ionization region of the mass spectrometer. It can also be applied to continuous
      vaporization and ionization schemes where one wants to pulse ions into a time of flight
      analyzer as particles arrive in the interaction region.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Nitric oxide (NO), a free radical endogenously synthesized in the human body,
      regulates a range of biological processes in the cardiovascular, genitourinary, respiratory,
      and nervous systems. With the discovery of NO as a potent inhibitor of platelet activation and
      its identification as an antibacterial agent, the utility of NO has been expanded to
      developing more biocompatible materials that resist to biofouling. My research has focused on
      the development of NO-releasing glucose biosensors via xerogel/polyurethane hybrid membranes
      that release NO in a controlled fashion. This new class of glucose biosensors was
      characterized by both adequate analytical response to glucose and improved bacterial adhesion
      resistance at NO fluxes greater than or equal to 5 pmol·cm-2·s-1 for 20 h. To further
      elucidate the complex and wide ranging roles of NO in physiology, an amperometric
      xerogel-based NO microsensor was fabricated. Several silicon-based NO sensor membranes were
      synthesized by doping alkyl/amino-alkoxysilane-based xerogels with Nafion. The performance of
      xerogel-based NO sensors was then evaluated to identify the optimum xerogel composition that
      maximized NO permeability and provided sufficient selectivity for NO. Xerogel permeability and
      selectivity were further manipulated as a function of specific reaction/processing conditions.
      The analytical performance of the xerogel-based sensor far exceeded that of current commercial
      sensors. Silica nanoparticles capable of controlled NO release were also synthesized via
      sol-gel chemistry. Control over both the structure and concentration of the silane precursors
      (i.e., tetraalkoxy- and aminoalkoxysilanes) and the synthetic conditions used to prepare the
      silica allowed for the preparation of NO donor-modified silica nanoparticles of widely varying
      size (d = 20 - 500 nm), NO payloads (50 - 74000 nmol·mg-1), maximum NO release amounts (10 -
      103000 ppb·mg-1), half-lives (0.1 - 12 h), and NO release durations (up to 30 h). Nitric
      oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles may prove useful in the development of glucose sensors
      with extended NO release durations and as new NO-derived anti-tumor chemotherapeutics.
      Preliminary studies evaluating the anti-cancer efficacy of NO-releasing silica nanocom-posites
      against human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cancer cells were conducted. The viability of
      HOSE cancer cells was significantly reduced upon exposure to the NO-releasing silica
      nanoparticles. Such scaffolds may allow for future tissue/cell targeting via particle size
      (enhanced permeability/retention effect) and/or ligand-receptor binding chemistry.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>An improved synthesis of the AB spiroketal of spongistatin is reported by making use
      of an asymmetric Mukaiyama-type aldol to install the C5 hydroxyl group selectively. A hetero-
      Diels-Alder cycloaddition-elimination sequence provides the pyrone core, upon which
      spiroketalization and further elaboration occurs to provide the completed AB spiroketal The
      synthesis of the protected aglycon of yokonolide A is also presented. This synthesis makes use
      of several asymmetric aldol and alkylation reaction to produce the main fragments. The endgame
      strategy adopts the use of an esterification-ring closing metathesis sequence to complete the
      protected core. Efforts toward the total synthesis of yokonolide A are also reported. Studies
      indicate that the success of the glycosylation reaction is dependent upon the structure of the
      glycosyl acceptor. Successful glycosyl donors have also been synthesized for use with these
      acceptors. Several routes have been explored which have led to protecting group challenges
      along the way. Efforts have also been made toward completion of the unprotected aglycon. This
      was undertaken to investigate a deprotection strategy for the natural product when a
      successful route is developed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The development of a functional multi-chambered contractile heart from a simple
      patterned tube involves a number of interacting transcriptional networks acting within
      well-defined temporal and spatial parameters. While many of the regulatory transcription
      factors have been identified and shown to be required for proper cardiogenesis, much remains
      to be deciphered regarding how these pathways interact at different times and within different
      cell populations during cardiogenesis. In addition, very little is currently known as to the
      specific downstream pathways affected by the various transcriptional regulators known to be
      involved in cardiac morphogenesis. In this dissertation, I describe the identification of
      several novel Xenopus laevis (X. laevis) genes expressed during heart development, including
      T-box 20 (Tbx20), titin novex 3 (XTn3), and heat shock protein 27 (XHsp27), thus providing
      evidence that these genes may be involved in cardiogenesis. By depleting X. laevis embryos of
      TBX20 and the related T-box protein, TBX5, I demonstrate that these proteins are both critical
      for proper cardiac morphogenesis. In addition, I provide evidence for a physical and
      functional interaction between TBX20 and TBX5 in cardiogenesis, thus adding one potential
      point at which multiple pathways may converge during heart development. Results from a
      microarray-based screen I conducted to identify genes downstream of Tbx5 function led to the
      identification of several cell cycle genes putatively misregulated in response to loss of
      TBX5. This work led directly to a study conducted by Sarah Goetz in which she has demonstrated
      a requirement for Tbx5 for proper cell cycle progression, thus further elucidating downstream
      pathways in heart development. A similar screen I performed to identify genes misregulated in
      response to loss of Tbx20 yielded a host of novel cardiac-specific genes, setting up the basis
      for future studies to come. This microarray experiment further resulted in the identification
      of Hsp27, which I subsequently demonstrated is required for proper fusion of cardiac
      precursors and for actin cytoskeleton integrity. Thus, this dissertation significantly
      advances our understanding of cardiogenesis at multiple levels, including the identification
      of factors involved in cardiogenesis, interactions between these factors, and downstream
      cellular behaviors affected by these factors.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The goal of embryogenesis is to convert a fertilized egg into an adult. To ensure that
      this process occurs normally, regulatory proteins act on the structural elements of a cell to
      change its position or shape. The resulting changes at a cellular level are coordinated within
      tissues and constitute a process termed morphogenesis. To date, many morphogenesis regulators
      have been identified in many model systems. The current aim is to understand how each
      regulator interacts with the others and with the structural elements of the cell such as the
      cell adhesion machinery and the cytoskeleton. In my thesis work, I have utilized epithelial
      development in Drosophila embryos as a model to investigate functions of the morphogenesis
      regulators Rho1 GTPase and Abelson (Abl) kinase. Rho GTPases have been linked to both
      regulation of cell-cell adhesion at adherens junctions (AJs) and the actin cytoskeleton. With
      respect to adhesion, conflicting evidence exists concerning how Rho interacts with core AJ
      components and the accessory AJ protein p120-catenin (p120). As part of my thesis work, I
      examined the role of Drosophila Rho1 during epithelial morphogenesis. I found that Rho1
      function is not dependent on p120, but that Rho1 regulates core AJ components. Further, my
      work suggests a mechanistic role for Rho1 in trafficking of the AJ protein cadherin. The
      second major area of my work examined the role of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abl during
      Drosophila morphogenesis. I identified a novel role for Abl in a specific type of apical cell
      shape change. Abl is required for apical constriction of mesodermal cells during gastrulation.
      Abl's regulation of its target Enabled and, consequently, the apical actin cytoskeleton is
      crucial for this function. This observation led me to test the roles of other ventral furrow
      regulators in apical actin regulation. I found that RhoGEF2 but not Concertina (G-alpha 12/13)
      also regulates apical actin during ventral furrow formation, possibly clarifying the
      difference in phenotypes of mutants of these two morphogenesis regulators. Finally, I
      developed and characterized new tools for studying Abl localization and activation. Overall,
      these studies will aid in efforts in understanding how to build an animal.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Amino acid radicals and radical cations formed through oxidation are characterized by
      Time-resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy. These oxidation processes
      occur through single-electron transfer events to excited triplet state anthraquinone
      photo-sensitizers, and by hydrogen atom transfer to hydroxyl radicals created in situ. The
      identity of the radicals formed by electron transfer is strongly dependent on the pH of the
      solution. In particular, a previously hypothesized cyclic methionine radical cation structure
      is directly observed on the sub-microsecond timescale. The uncharged carbon radicals formed by
      hydroxyl attack in oxygenated environments are found to form peroxyl adducts with molecular
      oxygen. The structures of these radicals are deduced by computer simulation of magnetic
      parameters. The radical intermediates created upon oxidation of diglycine by anthraquinone
      photosensitizers are used as probes for microscopic water pools formed in reverse micelles. A
      new "micro-reactor" model is used to simulate the chemically induced dynamic
      electron polarization of the TREPR radical signals. Radical diffusion coefficients are
      generated from these simulations from which the viscosities of the water pools can be
      calculated. Also, radicals formed from direct oxidation of the reverse micelle surfactant are
      observed and characterized by TREPR, the products are analyzed by chemically induced dynamic
      nuclear polarization.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this dissertation was to compare two models of the relationships among
      neurocognition, social cognition, and functional outcome in schizophrenia and highfunctioning
      autism (HFA). Forty-five participants with schizophrenia and thirty-four participants with HFA
      completed a battery of neurocognitive and social cognitive tasks, and the Social Functioning
      Scale as a measure of functional outcome. Composite variables were created for all three
      constructs. Within the schizophrenia sample, path analyses revealed a significant and negative
      relationship between neurocognition and functional outcome, a nonsignificant, positive
      relationship between social cognition and functional outcome, and modest support for social
      cognition serving as a mediator between neurocognition and functional outcome. Within the HFA
      sample, neither neurocognition nor social cognition significantly predicted functional
      outcome. Consistent with previous research, a strong, positive relationship between
      neurocognition and social cognition emerged in both samples, although this appears to be more
      robust for individuals with schizophrenia. In contrast, only a small proportion of the
      variance in functional outcome was accounted for by the models. It is suggested that use of
      the Social Functioning Scale may have contributed to these findings.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The Voronoi diagram is a fundamental geometric data structure and has been well
      studied in computational geometry and related areas. A Voronoi diagram defined using the
      Euclidean distance metric is also closely related to the Blum medial axis, a well known
      skeletal representation. Voronoi diagrams and medial axes have been shown useful for many 3D
      computations and operations, including proximity queries, motion planning, mesh generation,
      finite element analysis, and shape analysis. However, their application to complex 3D
      polyhedral and deformable models has been limited. This is due to the difficulty of computing
      exact Voronoi diagrams in an efficient and reliable manner. In this dissertation, we bridge
      this gap by presenting efficient algorithms to compute discrete Voronoi diagrams and
      simplified medial axes of 3D polyhedral models with geometric and topological guarantees. We
      apply these algorithms to complex 3D models and use them to perform interactive proximity
      queries, motion planning and skeletal computations. We present three new results. First, we
      describe an algorithm to compute 3D distance fields of geometric models by using a linear
      factorization of Euclidean distance vectors. This formulation maps directly to the linearly
      interpolating graphics rasterization hardware and enables us to compute distance fields of
      complex 3D models at interactive rates. We also use clamping and culling algorithms based on
      properties of Voronoi diagrams to accelerate this computation. We introduce surface distance
      maps, which are a compact distance vector field representation based on a mesh
      parameterization of triangulated two-manifolds, and use them to perform proximity
      computations. Our second main result is an adaptive sampling algorithm to compute an
      approximate Voronoi diagram that is homotopy equivalent to the exact Voronoi diagram and
      preserves topological features. We use this algorithm to compute a homotopy-preserving
      simplified medial axis of complex 3D models. Our third result is a unified approach to perform
      different proximity queries among multiple deformable models using second order discrete
      Voronoi diagrams. We introduce a new query called N-body distance query and show that
      different proximity queries, including collision detection, separation distance and
      penetration depth can be performed based on Nbody distance query. We compute the second order
      discrete Voronoi diagram using graphics hardware and use distance bounds to overcome the
      sampling errors and perform conservative computations. We have applied these queries to
      various deformable simulations and observed up to an order of magnitude improvement over prior
      algorithms.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The dissertation investigates the institutional and attitudinal effects of
      postcolonial citizenship on the stability of nation states and on the popular attitudes of
      citizens of selected African nations. The study of how citizens are connected to and perceive
      the state is an important question in understanding the long-term sustainability of African
      democratic systems. The dissertation is organized into three distinct chapters that are tied
      by common theoretical and empirical questions. Each employs different methods and levels of
      analysis in answering fundamental political questions about African postcolonial societies.
      These crucial questions revolve around institutional differences between urban and rural
      sectors and citizens of Africa. It studies the effects of urban- rural institutional dualisms
      in geographic, legal and citizenship dimensions. Furthermore, this work develops various
      statistical models to test the cross-national differences on various issues of importance to
      the continent. It looks into the effect of institutional dualism on state stability,
      constitutionalism and national identity in postcolonial African states and societies.
      Statistical analyses confirm that there is strong evidence for duality between urban and rural
      citizens in their support of constitutions and endorsement of traditional form of authority.
      This duality is stronger when inter-ethnic differences are controlled. Results also confirm
      that there is fundamental urban-rural duality in citizens' construction of national and group
      identity in African states.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>While sprouting angiogenesis is critical to blood vessel formation, the cellular and
      molecular controls of this process are poorly understood. As blood vessels form, the
      endothelial cells that comprise the vessel must coordinate the processes of cell division and
      cell migration for proper vascular morphogenesis to occur. Vascular endothelial growth
      factor-A (VEGF-A), an endothelial cell-specific ligand, is critical for these endothelial cell
      responses. Two high affinity receptors for VEGF-A, Flk-1 and Flt-1, are responsible for the
      effects of VEGF-A on vascular development. While VEGF-A signaling through Flk-1 has been shown
      to stimulate endothelial cell division, migration, and survival, the role of Flt-1 is less
      clear. Mice lacking the flt-1 receptor die around mid-gestation (E9.5) due to vascular
      overgrowth and disorganization. It is thought that Flt-1 acts to sequester VEGF-A, thereby
      inhibiting signaling through Flk-1. In my thesis work, I have used time-lapse imaging of
      GFP-expressing vessels derived from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, to reveal a role for
      flt-1 in modulating vascular branch (sprouts) formation and migration. Analysis of timelapse
      data also reveals that flt-1 mutant vessels have increased rates of endothelial cell division.
      This data supports a model whereby the role of flt-1 is to positively regulate sprout
      formation and migration and negatively regulate endothelial cell proliferation. Flt-1 is
      expressed as a full-length receptor tyrosine kinase (mFlt-1) and as a soluble isoform
      (sFlt-1). In order to get a clearer understanding of the role of the flt-1 isoforms in
      vascular development, I have reintroduced each flt-1 isoform into flt-1 mutant ES cells. My
      results reveal that the sFlt-1 isoform rescues the vessel branching morphogenesis defect
      observed in flt-1 mutant vessels, and that it does so more efficiently than the mFlt-1
      isoform. Furthermore, both flt-1 isoforms appear to partially rescue the cell proliferation
      defect. These results support a model whereby Flt-1 primarily affects vascular branching
      morphogenesis via a soluble molecule, sFlt-1, perhaps by affecting the formation of a VEGF-A
      gradient that normally provides directional information for sprouts. These results also reveal
      that both Flt-1 isoforms have the ability to regulate endothelial cell proliferation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>For the past decade, after the first afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) were
      observed, astronomers have puzzled over the question of why some bursts have bright optical
      afterglows, while others have no detected emission at all, despite quick, deep searches. The
      source of the darkness can reveal specific clues to the nature of the progenitor and its local
      environment, or hint at global information pertaining to star-formation rates or the early
      universe itself, for example. Astronomers have identified possible causes of dark afterglows:
      (1) the burst lies at high redshift, (2) the burst is extinguished by dust in the host galaxy,
      (3) the burst occurred in a low-density region, or (4) the intrinsic light from the burst is
      dim due to microphysical parameters of the shock. We present a two-pronged approach to
      understand the nature of dark and dim bursts. First, we detail the results of a large
      observing campaign designed to seek out and observe the optical and near-infrared afterglows
      of gamma-ray bursts in order to establish which are dark or dim. Secondly, we present PROMPT
      (Panchromatic Robotic Optical Monitoring and Polarimetry Telescopes), whose unique design
      allows it to identify afterglows that are highly reddened due to redshift and dust. PROMPT
      responds automatically to satellite notification, only tens of seconds after a GRB occurs, and
      can observe afterglows when they are at their brightest to discover dim afterglows that may
      have been missed with observations at later time. As proof of concept, I present a first look
      at the success of PROMPT's first year of operations and the eight rapid-time responses it
      made.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation investigates the sources of labor union bargaining power and the
      mechanisms that shape bargaining outcomes at the firm level in contemporary Chile. Set in
      2004, the study examines variation in labor union formal bargaining outcomes within and across
      four holding corporations operating in the banking, manufacturing, retail and
      telecommunications sectors. It answers two main questions. What was the extent of variation in
      formal union collective bargaining outcomes within and across these companies? Why did some
      unions perform better than others? In addition, it offers an overview of the current
      conditions of Chilean collective bargaining and an explanation of the general decline of labor
      union bargaining power in that country since 1990. The main argument put forth is that union
      bargaining outcomes within and across companies are explained by variation in four independent
      variables: workplace conditions, labor market conditions, product market conditions and union
      organizational strength. These factors combined determine the particular balance of power
      between workers and employers during the bargaining process, affecting union and management
      bargaining interactions and ultimately shaping differences in individual unions' collective
      bargaining outcomes. The higher the value on each of the independent variables, the greater
      the bargaining leverage of the union and thus the better the bargaining outcome.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Previous research suggests that schizophrenia and autism share similar behavioral
      deficits in social cognition. This study investigated both neural activation and behavioral
      performance during a task of complex social cognition in healthy controls, individuals with
      high-functioning autism, and individuals with schizophrenia. Event-related functional magnetic
      resonance imaging was utilized as individuals viewed faces and made ratings of
      trustworthiness. It was hypothesized that both clinical groups would show reduced activation
      in discrete brain regions comprising a social cognitive neural circuit, which included the
      amygdala, the fusiform face area (FFA) of the fusiform gyrus, and the superior temporal sulcus
      (STS). Activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) was also examined as this
      area has been implicated in the process of making evaluative judgments. Results largely
      confirmed the main study hypothesis: both clinical groups showed significant reductions in
      neural activation while making complex social judgments compared to nonclinical controls.
      Significant reductions for both clinical groups were evident in the right amygdala and FFA and
      left VLPFC, and no differences in neural activation were evident between the clinical groups.
      Behavioral performance on the Trustworthiness task significantly differed only between control
      individuals and individuals with schizophrenia; the two clinical groups did not significantly
      differ from one another. These findings suggest that individuals with schizophrenia and
      individuals with autism share similar neural abnormalities that may underlie social cognitive
      deficits.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The present paper examines self-mutilative behaviors (SMB) in a sample of male
      American veterans diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The study analyzed
      veterans' levels of PTSD symptomatology, depression, alcohol use, hostility, and impulsivity
      to determine which variables were related to SMB. Additionally, the antecedents and sequelae
      of SMB were examined to better understand the functions of these behaviors. A second type of
      "habit" behavior was examined as well: body-focused repetitive behaviors
      (BFRB). Findings indicated that veterans who did not engage in either type of habit behavior
      were older than those who engaged in SMB or BFRB. Veterans reporting SMB had higher levels of
      depression, hostility, and impulsivity compared to veterans who engaged in BFRB and those who
      engaged in no habit behaviors. Additionally, SMB was associated with higher levels of PTSD
      when compared to veterans who engaged in no habit behaviors. Results of a multinomial logistic
      regression analyses showed that age was the only variable which showed reliable enhanced
      prediction of group membership when controlling for all other variables. Examination of habit
      antecedents and sequelae showed support for the automaticiv positive reinforcement function of
      SMB. These findings are discussed in the context of research and treatment involving male
      veterans with PTSD who engage in SMB.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The design of real-time systems is being impacted by two trends. First,
      tightly-coupled multiprocessor platforms are becoming quite common. This is evidenced by the
      availability of affordable symmetric shared-memory multiprocessors and the emergence of
      multicore architectures. Second, there is an increase in the number of real-time systems that
      require only soft real-time guarantees and have workloads that necessitate a multiprocessor.
      Examples of such systems include some tracking, signal-processing, and multimedia systems. Due
      to the above trends, cost-effective multiprocessor-based soft real-time system designs are of
      growing importance. Most prior research on real-time scheduling on multiprocessors has focused
      only on hard real-time systems. In a hard real-time system, no deadline may ever be missed. To
      meet such stringent timing requirements, all known theoretically optimal scheduling algorithms
      tend to preempt process threads and migrate them across processors frequently, and also impose
      certain other restrictions. Hence, the overheads of such algorithms can significantly reduce
      the amount of useful work that is accomplished and limit their practical implementation. On
      the other hand, non-optimal algorithms that are more practical suffer from the drawback that
      their validation tests require workload restrictions that can approach roughly 50% of the
      available processing capacity. Thus, for soft real-time systems, which can tolerate occasional
      or bounded deadline misses, and hence, allow for a tradeoff between timeliness and improved
      processor utilization, the existing scheduling algorithms or their validation tests can be
      overkill. The thesis of this dissertation is: Processor utilization can be improved on
      multiprocessors while providing non-trivial soft real-time guarantees for different soft
      real-time applications, whose preemption and migration overheads can span different ranges and
      whose tolerances to tardiness are different, by designing new algorithms, simplifying optimal
      algorithms, and developing new validation tests. The above thesis is established by developing
      validation tests that are sufficient to provide soft real-time guarantees under non-optimal
      (but more practical) algorithms, designing and analyzing a new restricted-migration scheduling
      algorithm, determining the guarantees on timeliness that can be provided when some limiting
      restrictions of known optimal algorithms are relaxed, and quantifying the benefits of the
      proposed mechanisms through simulations. First, we show that both preemptive and
      non-preemptive global earliest-deadline-first(EDF) scheduling can guarantee bounded tardiness
      (that is, lateness) to every recurrent real-time task system while requiring no restriction on
      the workload (except that it not exceed the available processing capacity). The tardiness
      bounds that we derive can be used to devise validation tests for soft real-time systems that
      are EDF-scheduled. Though overheads due to migrations and other factors are lower under EDF
      (than under known optimal algorithms), task migrations are still unrestricted. This may be
      unappealing for some applications, but if migrations are forbidden entirely, then bounded
      tardiness cannot always be guaranteed. Hence, we consider providing an acceptable middle path
      between unrestricted-migration and no-migration algorithms, and as a second result, present a
      new algorithm that restricts, but does not eliminate, migrations. We also determine bounds on
      tardiness that can be guaranteed under this algorithm. Finally, we consider a more efficient
      but non-optimal variant of an optimal class of algorithms called Pfair scheduling algorithms.
      We show that under this variant, called earliest- pseudo-deadline-first (EPDF) scheduling,
      significantly more liberal restrictions on workloads than previously known are sufficient for
      ensuring a specified tardiness bound. We also show that bounded tardiness can be guaranteed if
      some limiting restrictions of optimal Pfair algorithms are relaxed. The algorithms considered
      in this dissertation differ in the tardiness bounds guaranteed and overheads imposed.
      Simulation studies show that these algorithms can guarantee bounded tardiness for a
      significant percentage of task sets that are not schedulable in a hard real-time sense.
      Furthermore, for each algorithm, conditions exist in which it may be the preferred choice.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this dissertation, we introduce a new class of spectral time stepping methods for
      efficient and accurate solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), differential
      algebraic equations (DAEs), and partial differential equations (PDEs). The methods are based
      on applying spectral deferred correction techniques as preconditioners to Picard integral
      collocation formulations, least squares based orthogonal polynomial approximations are
      computed using Gaussian type quadratures, and spectral integration is used instead of
      numerically unstable differentiation. For ODE problems, the resulting Krylov deferred
      correction (KDC) methods solve the preconditioned nonlinear system using Newton-Krylov schemes
      such as Newton-GMRES method. For PDE systems, method of lines transpose (MoLT ) couples the
      KDC techniques with fast elliptic equation solvers based on integral equation formulations and
      fast algorithms. Preliminary numerical results show that the new methods are of arbitrary
      order of accuracy, extremely stable, and very competitive with existing techniques,
      particularly when high precision is desired.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine how parents' academic expectations, and
      children's perceptions of those expectations, are related to the reading achievement of
      elementary school students, and how these relationships may differ for students at varying
      risk for poor reading. The study included data from a sample of 94 third and fourth grade
      students and their primary caretakers. Standardized measures of reading achievement along with
      experimental measures of academic expectations were administered to participants. Data were
      analyzed with the overall sample, and for subgroups of students at lower and higher risk for
      poor reading achievement, n = 64 and 30, respectively. Results suggested that when parents'
      expectations and children's perceptions, represented by composite scores, were examined
      together in one model, only parents' reports of their academic expectations were significantly
      related to the reading achievement of the overall sample. While parents' reported expectations
      were significantly related to end of year reading achievement for the lower risk group,
      neither parents' reports nor children's perceptions were significantly related to the reading
      achievement of the higher risk group. When different definitions of parents' academic
      expectations were examined as individual contributors, as opposed to a composite score,
      parents' estimates of their children's reading performance as compared to peers was most
      predictive of children's reading achievement for the overall sample and for children at lower
      risk for poor reading. In contrast, only parents' expectations for how much their child would
      like reading compared to peers was significantly related to the reading achievement of
      children at higher risk for poor reading. Parents' academic expectations for children's report
      card grades in reading and future educational attainment were also examined; however, their
      influence was more limited. This study contributed to the parent expectation literature by
      examining both parents' academic expectations and children's perceptions in elementary school
      aged children, as well as in children at higher risk for poor reading. Further, examining
      multiple definitions for academic expectations in one analysis allowed for a comparison of
      those individual items most significantly related to reading achievement.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Collectively, this body of research delineates the ways that contemporary Saban family
      life emerged through the creative interplay between past and present experiences of movement,
      labor, and family forged within the specificities of the on-going Saban Diaspora. Integrative
      sociodemographic and ethnographic analyses revealed that changes in these relationships have
      been most dynamic in the black population where non-marital childbearing and growing up in a
      non-marital home moved from a minority to a majority experience over the past 150 years and
      where many black women, through partner neglect or personal choice, came to inhabit the
      emotional and economic centers of their children's lives. Conversely, the social script for
      forming families in the white community stayed remarkably stable over time and is
      characterized by same-race marriage before childbearing and an increasingly challenged but
      still strong belief that women should primarily fulfill their roles as mother and homemaker
      while their men labor outside the domestic sphere. In addition to these general trends,
      divorce, multiple marriages, step-parent and half-sibling relationships, child support issues,
      and an increased prevalence of interracial and interethnic relationships and childbearing over
      the past 20 years have all added layers of complexity to family life in both communities and
      are connected to migration and labor experiences in myriad ways. Despite a gradual movement
      towards non-marital women-centered family forms in the black community and recent
      diversification of family life in the white community after a prolonged period of entrenched
      family-building norms, historical fluctuations in family formation patterns and Saban women's
      own perspectives on family life all show period and cohort-specific effects that are crucial
      to our understanding of how modern Saban family life evolved within the context of successive
      labor regimes and associated migration trends. Detailed quantitative and qualitative
      descriptions of these variations not only place family formation processes in their
      appropriate historical context but also deconstruct reified notions of "black family
      life" or "white family life" by showing both the dynamic
      demographic aspects of how all kinds of Sabans built their families over time and the changes
      in underlying social, economic, and cultural reasoning that precipitated stabilities and
      shifts in these processes.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The current study examines a paradox in the college student alcohol use literature
      where drinking to cope with negative affect (DTC) is concurrently and prospectively linked to
      problems with alcohol; however, experience sampling and daily diary studies have either failed
      to find a link between affect and drinking within a day, or found the relationship only under
      specific circumstances. Participants were 124 college students from a large Southeastern
      university. These individuals completed an online daily diary protocol for two weeks to report
      daily emotions, drinking motives and alcohol consumption. A series of HGLM analyses were
      conducted to test study hypotheses. The influence of self-awareness on the moderating effects
      of dispositional DTC on mood-drinking covariation were considered in two separate models, for
      global negative affect using the DTC subscale of Cooper's drinking motives questionnaire
      (1994) and also for sadness using a sadness specific measure of DTC. Neither the standard
      dispositional DTC model nor the dispositional sadness specific models were significant. DTC
      was also assessed as a daily process. The moderating effects of global negative affect and
      sadness specific daily drinking motives on mood-drinking covariation on drinking days was
      tested and a significant interaction between daily sadness motives, sad mood, and quantity of
      alcohol consumed was found. At relatively higher levels of daily sadness DTC individuals drank
      more when experiencing more sad mood and drank less when experiencing less sad mood, whereas
      those relatively low in DTC drank less on days with more sad mood and drank more on days with
      less sad mood. The global negative affect model was not supported. Post-hoc analyses were
      conducted to examine potential methodological explanations for the lack of findings in the
      three of the four models tested. Strengths, limitations, clinical implications and future
      directions are discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Batesian mimicry, the adaptive resemblance of harmless organisms (mimics) to harmful
      organisms (models) that causes predators to avoid both models and mimics, occurs in diverse
      taxa. Despite the fascination that mimicry complexes generate, many questions remain
      unanswered concerning the role of mimicry in evolution. My Ph.D. research has examined the
      evolution of a snake mimicry complex in the southeastern United States in which selection on
      the mimetic phenotype varies spatially in magnitude and direction. The mimic, harmless scarlet
      kingsnakes (Lampropeltis triangulum elapsoides), and the model, venomous eastern coral snakes
      (Micrurus fulvius), vary in absolute and relative abundance such that the model is more common
      deep within its range and the mimic is more abundant at the edge of the model's range. Also,
      despite selection against the mimetic phenotype outside the range of the model, the range of
      the mimic exceeds that of the model (an area termed allopatry). Therefore, I sought to
      determine: 1) what evolutionary mechanisms maintain the mimic in allopatry, 2) whether there
      has been an evolutionary response to selection against the mimetic phenotype in allopatry, and
      3) whether spatial variation in the relative abundance of models and mimics leads to spatial
      variation in the degree to which mimics resemble the local model. A potential confounding
      factor in the evolution of the mimetic phenotype in L. t. elapsoides is interbreeding with
      non-mimetic conspecifics. Therefore, I looked for gene flow from non-mimetic conspecifics and
      examined the relationship between L. t. elapsoides and the rest of Lampropeltis. My results
      indicate that the best mimics occur at the edge of the model's range and that gene flow from
      there into allopatry maintains the mimetic phenotype in allopatry. Despite gene flow,
      selection against the mimetic phenotype is decreasing the resemblance between allopatric L. t.
      elapsoides and M. fulvius. Additionally, gene flow from non-mimetic L. triangulum is not
      altering the phenotype of L. t. elapsoides, and, in fact, the scarlet kingsnake diverged from
      other Lampropeltis millions of years ago. Thus, I recommend re-elevating the scarlet kingsnake
      to full species status and renew the use of L. elapsoides.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this dissertation, I argue that moods can be intentional states, that is, they can
      be about something. I make this case by exploring the moods that underlie two
      psychopathological diagnoses: depression and borderline personality disorder (BPD). The view
      that moods can be intentional is counter to dominant positions in both philosophy and
      medicine. This project has three elements. First, I critically examine current medical
      approaches to depression and BPD. I distinguish two dominant models of medical practice and
      argue that many medical practitioners within both models (implicitly) deny the potential
      intentionality of moods. This results in a widespread medical mischaracterisation of
      depression and BPD. Second, I argue that the intentional features of those moods that underlie
      depression and BPD can be appreciated when one assumes the role first of 'affective
      reconstructor' and then of 'affective interlocutor.' Affective reconstructors explore the
      origins of someone's mood with the aim of identifying its intentional object(s). If an
      intentional object is found, one can assume the role of affective interlocutor. In that role
      one actively engages with the mood experiencer, carefully considering whether those
      intentional object(s) fit appropriately with the mood. Third, once the moods that underlie
      depression and BPD are seen as potentially intentional, I argue that they may be 'moral
      moods.' I use case studies of sufferers of depression and BPD, particularly the character of
      Sophie (from William Styron's novel Sophie's Choice) and Lilah, a composite of several
      patients diagnosed with BPD. I argue that their moods are responses to moral violation.
      Non-intentional accounts of moods, either philosophical or medical, will fail to acknowledge
      the moral dimension of these moods. I argue that this is a substantial failure, both for
      Sophie and Lilah and also for those around them, who will miss the opportunity to fully
      understand their experiences.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>A protein's amino acid sequence determines both its chemical and its physical
      structures, and together these two structures determine its function. Protein designers seek
      new amino acid sequences with chemical and physical structures capable of performing some
      function. The vast size of sequence space frustrates efforts to find useful sequences. Protein
      designers model proteins on computers and search through amino acid sequence space
      computationally. They represent the three-dimensional structures for the sequences they
      examine, specifying the location of each atom, and evaluate the stability of these structures.
      Good structures are tightly packed but are free of collisions. Designers seek a sequence with
      a stable structure that meets the geometric and chemical requirements to function as desired;
      they frame their search as an optimization problem. In this dissertation, I present a
      graphical model of the central optimization problem in protein design, the
      side-chain-placement problem. This model allows the formulation of a dynamic programming
      solution, thus connecting side-chain placement with the class of NP-complete problems for
      which certain instances admit polynomial time solutions. Moreover, the graphical model
      suggests a natural data structure for storing the energies used in design. With this data
      structure, I have created an extensible framework for the representation of energies during
      side-chain-placement optimization and have incorporated this framework into the Rosetta
      molecular modeling program. I present one extension that incorporates a new degree of
      structural variability into the optimization process. I present another extension that
      includes a non-pairwise decomposable energy function, the first of its kind in protein design,
      laying the ground-work to capture aspects of protein stability that could not previously be
      incorporated into the optimization of side-chain placement.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>My examination asserts that Ernest Hemingway's modernity lies beyond mere stylistic
      technique and aesthetic concerns and finds itself in what perhaps is an inadvertent
      appreciation of W.E. B. Du Bois' prognostication that race would be the pervasive issue for a
      "progressive" nation looking to the first decades of the twentieth century.
      I contend that Hemingway not only shares Faulkner's concerns with the issue of race in
      America, but that he takes them well beyond the bounds of the South or any particular region
      and extends them to the rest of the nation. Little to nothing has been said about Hemingway's
      investment in issues of race; this examination intends to end that relative silence.
      Hemingway's marked interest in race (de)formation is closely aligned to a vested national
      interest in and an anxiety over a rapidly changing American racial topography and issues of
      American (White) identity. The works in this examination become then an expression of what I
      will call a collective angst in the wake of a perpetually fading color line and,
      correspondingly, an ever-eroding Anglo power structure. Hemingway's reaction is a simultaneous
      questioning of (White) self-identity and coveted authoritarian right and a marked
      re-entrenchment in standard racial typology. The so-called Indian stories work well to explore
      ideas of miscegenation (I use this term broadly to suggest race mixing and influence in a
      general sense) and White "vulnerability," and they attest to the author's
      ambivalence. Hemingway's African American centered stories continue this exploration of
      color-line transgression and the deconstruction of White identity, with the added element of
      violence as a possible means to that end. Thus, Africa becomes Hemingway's imaginative enclave
      of Anglo agency. Moreover, imperial Africa (more specifically, the metaphorical, geopolitical
      space inhabited by the Anglo) becomes the site within which he, as White subject-self, can
      control the placement, demarcation, and enforcement of that coveted colorline. This very
      emphatic racial awareness, nonetheless, is what also draws Hemingway into the realm of the
      Modern.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Based on 59 in-depth interviews with women who defined themselves as depressed after
      the birth or adoption of a child, this dissertation examines post-partum and post-adoptive
      depression (PPD and PAD, respectively). In Chapter 1, I address the women's discrepant
      feelings in relation to motherhood and analyze how they came to take on the labels PPD and
      PAD. Experiencing discrepant emotions, they tried to convince themselves that they were not
      bad mothers. After looking for alternative explanations, the women performed the work that
      "good mothers" should. They hoped that this would transform their feelings,
      but those feelings moved from discrepant to deviant emotions (Thoits 1985). Eventually, they
      blamed themselves for their feelings and appropriated the label. Some sought help from
      healthcare providers; others found relief in non-medical solutions and non-mother identities.
      In Chapter 2, I analyze the husbands' strategies for alleviating their wives' pain. Doing
      emotion work, which is defined as women's work (Bartky 1990), might have threatened their
      masculinity. But, the strategies ultimately shored up white, middle-class masculinity. Guided
      by ideas of masculine control (Johnson 2005), the men offered breaks from child care, took
      charge of the situation, asked their wives to cheer up, and avoided conflict. They did so in
      ways that allowed them to believe they were good companionate husbands and fathers. The women
      reported mixed evaluations of their husbands' efforts. They appreciated their husbands'
      "help," but their husbands did not change the women's circumstances or
      feelings. In Chapter 3, I examine how adoptive parents dealt with the complex deviance
      associated with adoption. Adoption is simultaneously a form of positive and negative deviance.
      Adoptive parents fulfill prescriptions to become parents, but do so by means that are still
      considered dubious or "second best" (Fisher 2003). Parents managed the
      negative aspects of adoption by approximating biology: seeking children with similar physical
      characteristics and invoking cultural scripts associated with pregnancy and childbirth.
      Parents managed the positives by rejecting others' comments that they were "rescuing
      children"; these "compliments" devalued their children as charity
      cases. Finally, the parents ennobled themselves and their children for having endured more
      hardships in becoming a family.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>"Patchwork Nation" explores white southerners' conceptions of
      nationalism during the American Civil War era. The core impetus of Confederate nationalism was
      the desire to preserve slavery, but my emphasis is on the broad range of intellectual,
      cultural, and personal sources that white southerners drew upon as they engaged the concept of
      nationalism in their lives. Investigating these sources pushes our understanding of
      Confederate nationalism in three previously neglected directions: outward, backward, and
      inward. White southerners conceived of Confederate nationalism in light of what they already
      knew about the concept. Nationalism was then enjoying a golden age in Europe, and
      transatlantic intellectual currents greatly influenced ideas about nationalism in the American
      South. Hence our turn outward. But the nationalism with which white southerners were most
      familiar was antebellum American nationalism, in which most of them had been enthusiastic
      participants. Hence our turn backward. In defining a new nationalism, they replicated many
      aspects of the old, in both substantive and conceptual terms. Such replication generated a
      persistent problem that will concern us throughout: how could the South retain the nationalism
      of a country from which it had voluntarily departed? Our final turn takes us inward, into the
      sphere of everyday life. Confederate nationalism came to matter to individual white
      southerners because of the ways they connected it to their personal identities and the fabric
      of their daily lives. Thus they defined individual responsibility to the nation by using ideas
      about manhood and womanhood, morality and religious beliefs, sacrifice and daily suffering.
      Connections between individuals and the nation were especially intense when they involved
      perceptions of shared victimhood at the hands of the northern enemy. When this sense of
      victimhood came to encompass not just slavery and politics but personal fears as well, it
      became the most potent source of nationalism of all. The image of a patchwork captures the way
      that white southerners drew on all of these resources in conceiving of Confederate nationalism
      and in defining their individual connections to it. This was a nationalism crafted by many
      hands, using varied materials, with a pattern that emerged only in the making.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation is a cross-cultural examination of the creation and the
      sociocultural implications of the languages of pain in the works of French author, Marguerite
      Duras and Mexican painter, Frida Kahlo. Recent studies have determined that discursive
      communication is insufficient in expressing one's pain. In particular, Elaine Scarry maintains
      that pain destroys language and that its victims must rely on the vocabulary of other cultural
      spheres in order to express their pain. The problem is that neither Scarry nor any other
      Western pain scholar can provide an alternative to discursive language to express pain. This
      study claims that both artists must work beyond their own cultural registers in order to give
      their pain a language. In the process of expressing their suffering, Duras and Kahlo subvert
      traditional literary and artistic conventions. Through challenging literary and artistic
      forms, they begin to re-think and ultimately re-define the way their readers and viewers
      understand feminine subjectivity, colonial and wartime occupation, personal tragedy, the
      female body, Christianity and Western hegemony.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The understanding of molecular recognition events is of great importance to current
      chemical research. This work documents two examples of molecular recognition in synthetic
      systems. Molecularly imprinted polymers containing platinum have been synthesized that can
      differentiate between enantiomers in a ligand exchange reaction. The use of laser polarimetry
      as a method to detect enantioselective interactions in a racemic dynamic combinatorial library
      is also described. Platinum-containing molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) were synthesized
      by the covalent incorporation of polymerizable P2Pt((S)-BINOL) metallodendrimers constructed
      with a rigid phenyl benzoate ester linkage into a highly-porous and cross-linked
      methacrylate-based polymer. The enantioselectivity of the polymer with respect to BINOL ligand
      exchange reactions was studied and compared to similar polymers prepared from
      metallodendrimers containing a conformationally flexible phenyl benzyl ether linkage. The
      rigidity of the ester linkage resulted in higher enantioselectivities for a BINOL/Br2BINOL
      ligand exchange reaction as compared to the ether linkage. The most selective polymer
      exchanged (±)-Br2BINOL for (S)-BINOL at the platinum sites with an enantioselectivity of 82:18
      which equals the highest observed for these polymers. At elevated temperatures preferential
      deactivation of the less hindered, and therefore less selective sites, is observed due to the
      thermolytic cleavage of the BINOL ligand. These polymers exhibit enantioselective molecular
      recognition for the imprinted enantiomer of BINOL through outer-sphere control by the polymer
      matrix. The study of laser polarimetric detection for the analysis of dynamic combinatorial
      libraries comprised of racemic compounds was undertaken in an effort to identify
      enantioselective molecular recognition. An enantioselective receptor for the biologically
      important molecule (-)-adenosine was identified in this manner. This demonstrates a novel and
      efficient method for the study of enantioselective molecular recognition in synthetic systems.
      The use of deuterium-labeled species was developed as a method for identifying the
      stereochemistry of the receptor of interest by mass spectrometry. This method was also used to
      quantify the diastereomeric composition of a library component. This work proves that used
      together in this manner, laser polarimetry, dynamic combinatorial chemistry, and mass
      spectrometry are powerful strategies for the continued study of enantioselective molecular
      recognition.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Because the gamma prime chain of fibrinogen has been hypothesized as a binding site
      for factor XIII zymogen, I prepared two recombinant fibrinogen variants, a gamma prime/gamma
      prime fibrinogen homodimer and a gamma prime/gamma prime fibrinogen heterodimer.
      Characterization of their expression in CHO cells revealed the following: 1) gamma prime chain
      protein is produced in about the same proportion as gamma prime mRNA in any given cell line.
      2) gamma prime and gamma prime chains assemble into homodimeric fibrinogen molecules as
      readily as they do heterodimers. 3) Mass spectrometry studies indicate that one of two
      tyrosine residues in the recombinant gamma prime chain is sulfated. I next characterized the
      polymerization of purified recombinant gamma prime/gamma prime and gamma prime/gamma prime
      fibrinogen. As measured by turbidity, the presence of the gamma prime chain leads to decreased
      lateral aggregation at all calcium concentrations studied. I monitored fibrinopeptide release
      by HPLC and found that release of fibrinopeptide A occurs at the same rate regardless of the
      presence of a gamma prime chain, but fibrinopeptide B release is faster from gamma prime/gamma
      prime than gamma prime/gamma prime or gamma prime/gamma prime fibrinogen. Factor
      XIIIa-catalyzed cross-linking of the variants starts at a slower rate for fibrinogens with a
      gamma prime chain than it does for those without. I then used the gamma prime/gamma prime and
      gamma prime/gamma prime fibrinogen variants in an ELISA assay to measure factor XIII binding
      to fibrinogen and fibrin. I studied binding of factor XIII zymogen, recombinant factor XIII
      composed of just A subunits, and active-site-inhibited, activated recombinant factor XIIIa. No
      matter what form the factor XIII is in, or whether fibrinogen or fibrin is used, these
      experiments clearly showed that the gamma prime chain has no role in factor XIII binding to
      fibrinogen.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The first half of this dissertation presents a hypothesis to explain the abrupt
      climate changes that occurred during the last ice age. The Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO)
      oscillations are a prime example of abrupt climate changes in the paleoclimate record, clear
      evidence that large and extremely rapid climate fluctuations have repeatedly happened in the
      recent past. There is wide agreement that a likely driver for the DO oscillations may involve
      changes in the strength of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC). A 3D coupled global
      atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice model of intermediate complexity, ECBilt-Clio, is used here to study
      the natural variability of the THC and associated climate changes in the North Atlantic. Under
      boundary conditions appropriate for the last glacial period the model simulations produce
      large amplitude, DO-like oscillations. Since no varying external forcing is applied, this is
      an internally driven, self-sustained, nonlinear free oscillation of the THC. It is argued that
      the free oscillation is caused by energy imbalance between the advection of cold water and the
      diffusion of heat by vertical turbulent mixing in the high latitude deep ocean. In addition,
      another hypothesis is proposed to explain the timing of the DO events. It is argued that the
      pattern is created by the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, which modulates the free
      oscillating mode of the THC. This speculation is supported by the ECBilt-Clio model, as well
      as an independent conceptual model SVO (Saltzman-van der Pol Oscillator). This hypothesis
      suggests that abrupt climate change is most likely to happen when insolation is rapidly
      changing. Since astronomical forcing is readily predictable, it is in principle possible to
      anticipate long-term (centennial to millennial), large amplitude, abrupt climate change
      events. In the second half, the work from my secondary PhD project, which is totally
      independent from the aforementioned study, is presented. An inversion scheme is introduced to
      deduce subsurface crack model, namely crack strike, dip and crack density, by using shear-wave
      splitting polarization and delay time observations.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The surfaces of real-world objects almost never intersect, so the human visual system
      is ill prepared to deal with this rare case. However, the comparison of two similar models or
      approximations of the same surface can require simultaneous estimation of individual global
      shape, estimation of point or feature correspondences, and local comparisons of shape and
      distance between the two surfaces. A key supposition of this work is that these relationships
      between intersecting surfaces, especially the local relationships, are best understood when
      the surfaces are displayed such that they do intersect. For instance, the relationships
      between radiation iso-dose levels and healthy and tumorous tissue is best studied in context
      with all intersections clearly shown. This dissertation presents new visualization techniques
      for general layered surfaces, and intersecting surfaces in particular, designed for scientists
      with problems that require such display. The techniques are enabled by a union/intersection
      refactoring of intersecting surfaces that converts them into nested surfaces, which are more
      easily treated for visualization. The techniques are aimed at exploratory visualization, where
      accurate performance of a variety of tasks is desirable, not just the best technique for one
      particular task. User studies, utilizing tasks selected based on interviews with scientists,
      are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the new techniques, and to compare them to some
      existing, common techniques. The studies show that participants performed the user study tasks
      more accurately with the new techniques than with the existing techniques.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Much of the popular literature sees the inequality of African-Americans as a problem
      of differential legal standing that is solved through introducing complete legal formal
      equality with laws that are administered impartially and neutrally. Any further difficulties
      in the distribution of benefits and burdens are seen mainly as the problem of the group
      itself, as failures at being self-determining. But recently, social scientists have become
      increasingly wary of the claim that the blacks are simply failing at becoming
      self-determining, as even a cursory glance at the major indices of welfare reveal that the
      barriers to equality for blacks are systemic. The current view is that the best way to
      determine policies is to eliminate, or at least to seriously mitigate, the effects of race and
      racial identity on policies that distribute the benefits and burdens of society. The
      skepticism about race and racial identity is driven by the concern that racial identity is
      troublesome from the moral point of view because it is thought that racial identities,
      especially the racial identities of blacks, are predicated on self-defeating conceptions of
      race and racial identity. I argue that these views are predicated on a shallow and faulty
      understanding of racial identity and that with a more nuanced understanding of racial identity
      we can avoid these problems and we can understand how policies that promote racial identity
      might empower blacks.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this dissertation the author explores what could be learned about the development
      of social inequality from a small-scale analysis. The people on whom the author focuses
      inhabited the Moche valley of north coastal of Perú and were one of the earliest New World
      groups to develop a state-level political organization (Bawden 1996; Billman 1996; Moseley
      1992). Prior to this development, Moche valley residents lived in societies that were far less
      politically centralized and socially differentiated. The author uses bioarchaeological data to
      investigate changes in the activities of prehistoric, north coastal Peruvians. The author
      interprets patterns of change in daily activities within the wider archaeological context and
      in light of other studies of state societies to explore how people, through their daily
      actions, effected and reflected large-scale economic, social, and political change. To address
      these issues, the remains of 750 individuals recovered from Cerro Oreja, a large prehistoric
      urban center in the Moche valley of Perú were examined. Cerro Oreja was continuously occupied
      from the beginning of irrigation agriculture through the formation of the Southern Moche state
      (1800 BC-AD 400), and residents buried their dead in the site's cemeteries throughout this
      period (Carcelen personal comm 1999). The remains of the individuals who are the subject of
      this study represent women, men, and children of both high and low status. The author examined
      each of these individual for dental caries, wear, abscesses, periodontal disease, antemortem
      tooth loss, and dental trauma. Additionally, the bones and teeth of several individuals were
      sampled for stable isotopic and dental calculus analyses. These data provide evidence to
      reconstruct diet and non-dietary tooth use at Cerro Oreja. However, these data are combined
      with the age-at-death and sex estimations and social status assessments, to trace agricultural
      intensification, chicha consumption, craft specialization, and coca use in the Moche valley.
      These findings revealed that although increased agricultural production, chicha consumption,
      and access to coca were important loci of pre-state social and political change, gender was
      the central axis along which these changes occurred. By expanding existing gender differences,
      elites created the social hierarchies that came to characterize the Southern Moche state.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>A statistical analysis of data collected via self-reporting questionnaires and
      participant observation in Ried im Innkreis, Austria, shows that the speakers in this
      community typically prefer to speak their local dialect rather than Standard German or
      colloquial varieties, at a significantly higher frequency in more domains than speakers in
      other communities of similar size in Austria. Data from Ried im Innkreis are compared with
      results from Steinegger (1998) and Wiesinger (1989b), in which similar surveys were
      distributed throughout Austria. Factors that typically correlate with the choice of dialect
      over colloquial or standard varieties of German in large cities in Austria, such as
      socioeconomic class, do not play a significant role in Ried im Innkreis due to the small size
      of the community. The same trends apparent in the rest of the Austria with regard to gender
      are apparent in Ried. Males report that they speak dialect slightly more often than females,
      and a decrease in dialect use by females is indicated which corresponds to typical
      child-raising years and retirement. The trends for age and dialect frequency are generally
      consistent with previous findings for Austria. School-aged speakers report that they use
      dialect more often than adults. Adult commuters speak dialect more often than non-commuters in
      intimate situations with family and friends. School-aged commuters report that they speak less
      dialect than non-commuters in school and when speaking with strangers. Social network strength
      is a significant factor, and correlates positively with frequency of dialect use, but only in
      situations where speaker is in their own social network. Speakers' attitudes regarding dialect
      and Standard German, speakers of dialect, and their own choice of speech variety can provide
      psychological explanations for their choice of variety in a given domain. Positive attitudes
      regarding the dialect itself, speakers of the local dialect and local loyalty are positively
      correlated with frequency of dialect use. Predictions for the future vitality of the local
      dialect are also made, based on current and historical demographic trends and the respondents'
      attitudes regarding dialect and standard varieties of German.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation discusses methodologies of teaching stressing relationships between
      class participants through the development of a "community of difference"
      that uses a "dialogue of difference." In these classrooms, community creates
      a constructive space for incorporating the lived experiences and multiple identities of
      individuals into learning processes, favoring the development of critical thought, individual
      voice, and awareness of difference. My pedagogy combines writing center and composition
      studies models for writing and discourse communities with the work of Black feminist theorists
      like Patricia Collins and bell hooks. These women conceptualize community and identity
      theories that support the idea of selfredefinition within community that may lead to greater
      understanding of difference. I also draw on Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of the
      "utterance" to call attention to the ways language may represent individual
      experience and knowledge. An instructor can employ language use and relationship in a
      classroom community as a dialogue of difference that critically considers sociohistorical and
      immediate forces that affect individual experience and identity. In addition to developing
      self-definition, this kind of environment can also be used to stress continual
      self-redefinition within community and a responsibility towards recognizing difference in
      community. The autobiographical first chapter, "Biography of a Pedagogy,"
      positions the development of my pedagogical and methodological convictions at the
      cross-section of my own sociohistorical circumstances and experience. I present my subsequent
      theoretical work with a number of composition theorists and Black feminist theorists, and
      Mikhail Bakhtin in the second chapter, and the last chapter addresses the practice of
      relationship and research on the subject.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>During the past twenty years there has been an increase in the number and variety of
      school choice policy options in education. Influential articles and reports such as A Nation
      at Risk document the failures of our public education system with tales of gaps in achievement
      by race, gender, social class, and country. School choice is widely discussed as a solution to
      these, and other, issues. Administered appropriately, proponents argue, school choice could
      liberate low-income and minority students from their underperforming schools and give them
      access to the higher performing schools of the upper and middle class. Yet, there is also
      evidence of unintended consequences resulting from school choice such as increased racial and
      socioeconomic segregation. The three papers included in this dissertation discuss and evaluate
      different aspects of school choice. The first paper, "Evaluating School Choice:
      Considerations for Research and Policy," discusses the varieties and extent of school
      choice currently available in the United States, summarizes the multidisciplinary theory that
      frames school choice research, and develops a conceptual framework based on theory and
      educational purpose as a guide to future evaluations. The second paper, "Racial and
      Socioeconomic Segregation in a District with Controlled School Choice," uses a
      multilevel comparison model to examine the relationship between a controlled choice student
      assignment plan and racial and socioeconomic segregation over an eleven-year period. Findings
      indicate an increase in school-level racial and socioeconomic segregation within the district
      during the implementation of the student assignment plan. The third paper, "School
      Choice, Racial Segregation, and Student Academic Outcomes," uses a multilevel growth
      model to examine the impact of attending racially segregated schools on academic test scores.
      The results confirm previous research regarding the racial achievement gap and indicate no
      discernable effect on student achievement growth over time that can be attributed to the
      racial makeup of the school.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The role of faith-based organizations in the provision of social services has gained
      increasing attention since Charitable Choice passed as a provision of the Personal
      Responsibility Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act of 1996. Under George W. Bush,
      faith-based social services took center stage in the domestic policy debates. One element of
      the rhetoric surrounding public support of faith-based interventions has been the talk of
      their effectiveness. Unfortunately, few studies have ever attempted to assess the outcomes of
      faith-based social interventions, and the studies that have been conducted report mixed
      findings. The notion of the effectiveness of faith-based interventions has largely been taken
      on faith. This study used longitudinal administrative data matched with earnings histories to
      assess the impact a faith-based intervention had on earnings, poverty status, and employment
      stability in three North Carolina counties. There was no significant difference between the
      outcomes of a faith-based and a similar secular intervention when earnings, poverty status,
      and employment stability were assessed. These findings are consistent with other major studies
      of welfare to work programs, suggesting the need to assess the structure of low-wage work in
      the United States.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this dissertation, I consider the stance that a liberal democratic state should
      take with respect to intimate relationships among citizens. My basic argument is that an
      adequate vision of the family-state relationship must pay significant respect to the standard
      liberal goods of freedom and equality, and yet it must also recognize that a liberal society's
      respect for human dignity requires it to foster caretaking and human development. The best way
      to harmonize these goods, I argue, is for the state to allow individuals a significant degree
      of freedom to pursue their own visions of the good life while requiring the state to support
      the institutional conditions that facilitate families' capacity for caretaking and human
      development. I offer my "supportive state" model to illustrate how a liberal
      democratic polity should organize its family-state relations and reconcile the tensions among
      these important goods. In the first two chapters of the book, I consider the absence of
      families in contemporary liberal theory and engage a broad spectrum of liberalism's
      critics-from communitarians, to civic liberal revisionists, feminists, and queer theorists-to
      consider alternative visions of the family-state relationship. In the following three
      chapters, I argue for a "supportive state" model of the family-state
      relationship, in which families bear responsibility for caring for and organizing the care of
      family members, but the state bears a simultaneous responsibility to ensure that societal
      institutions support caretaking and human development. I develop the contours of this model in
      the context of discussing caretaker-dependent relationships, relationships among generally
      able adults, and relationships of political socialization and the transmission of civic norms
      and values. In the final two chapters, I critique current law and public policy and the vision
      of the family-state relationship on which it rests. I argue that both current child welfare
      law and work-and-family law and policy are built on unrealistic and unproductive assumptions
      that assign the state a peripheral role in supporting caretaking. These areas of law, I
      contend, would be better grounded on a supportive state model.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Each day 1000 older adults die in nursing homes and another 500 in residential
      care/assisted living facilities. In addition, 30% of Medicare deaths in hospitals are recent
      transfers from long-term care, indicating that long-term care facilities are a major provider
      of end-of-life care for older adults. Yet, end of life care in these settings is largely
      unexamined. One reason for this omission is the challenging nature of the work as described in
      the introduction to this dissertation. However, the dissertation addresses those challenges
      and gives voice to the needs of residents who die in these settings through three papers based
      on the input of residents, bereaved family members, and staff caregivers. The first paper,
      Dying in Long-Term Care: Insights from Residents, Family Members and Staff, is based on ten
      focus groups in which participants were asked to describe a good death. They The second paper,
      Defining a Good Death: Family Members Speak, describes family responses to two open-ended
      questions regarding what was best and what could have been done better in the last month of
      the resident's life. The third paper, Measuring the Quality of Dying in Long- Term Care,
      introduces a new measure, of the Quality of Dying in Long-term Care (QODLTC), to be used for
      future research in these settings. Each paper makes a significant contribution to the
      literature, both by describing what is done well and where improvements can be made.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Anti-selective aldol additions between the titanium enolates of N-glycolyl
      oxazolidinethiones and simple aldehydes are described. Variation to the Lewis acid
      stoichiometry of known syn aldol conditions led to a reversal of stereoselectivity favoring
      formation of one anti diastereomer. Highest selectivity and yield were observed using
      alpha,beta-allyloxy glycolylimides and aliphatic, unbranched aldehydes. Other suitably
      protected imides and alpa,beta-unsaturated or aromatic aldehydes were also viable reacting
      partners. Application of the anti glycolate aldol additions toward the stereoselective
      synthesis of the BCDE fragment of the potent red tide neurotoxin brevetoxin A is also
      described. Synthesis of the B ring began with an anti aldol addition to set the C3 and C4
      stereogenic centers. Further elaboration using glycolate alkylation and ring-closing
      metathesis reactions provided the B ring core. The E ring fragment likewise utilized anti
      aldol methodology to rapidly access a diene fragment needed to close the nine-membered ring. A
      novel convergent coupling strategy was developed for the synthesis of the completed
      trans-fused BCDE tetracycle from the individual B and E units. This approach relied on a
      Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction to join the two complex fragments. Enone reduction and
      subsequent cyclodehydration generated an intermediate endocyclic enol ether representing the
      B, C, and E rings. Elaboration of the enol ether intermediate via oxidation, cyclization of
      the D ring, and ketal reduction then provided the completed BCDE fragment. A revised synthesis
      of this molecule was subsequently developed to provide the onecarbon homologated version
      needed for eventual completion of the natural product. The E ring revision is highlighted by a
      novel glycolate alkylation using bromoacetonitrile and several protecting group alterations.
      Significant improvements to the convergent assembly were realized during the revision,
      providing the BCDE fragment in significantly higher yield from the individual rings and in
      fewer synthetic steps. Finally, the A ring lactone was formed, providing the complete ABCDE
      pentacycle.</mods:abstract>

      aggregate data from the interviews and data analysis provide the basis for understanding
      annotation's utility for future users, and the development of more robust and useful music
      digital library tools and systems. This research also has the more general and theoretical
      applicability for those interested in how humans interact with interpretable, structured,
      largely symbolic and formalized information. Bringing together practical applications and
      theoretical concerns, the findings generated by this research will have wide effect in the
      Information Science community.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Packera millefolium is a rare species endemic to rock outcrops in the southern
      Appalachians thought to hybridize with its more common congener, P. anonyma. Morphological
      analyses and cross-pollination experiments were used to verify the existence of the hybrid
      Packera ×memmingeri. Preliminary results show that introgression between P. millefolium and P.
      anonyma is probable at some locations. Information on population size and the presence or
      absence of hybrids was compiled for populations of P. millefolium from historical records and
      on-site surveys. An analysis of this data shows that hybrids occur at approximately 40% of the
      populations in North and South Carolina. The data also suggests that anthropogenic disturbance
      of the landscape surrounding once isolated populations of P. millefolium might have broken
      down the ecological barriers that historically prevented gene flow between P. millefolium and
      P. anonyma. The management implications for P. millefolium due to hybridization with P.
      anonyma are discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Charter schools have been promoted as being more innovative than traditional public
      schools, but that is not always the case. Change agents can transform either type of public
      school. Both types of schools can also rely on traditional practices, which are not as
      innovative as they are reliable. This research focuses on a charter school and a neighboring
      district school that were transformed by change agent leadership. The results indicate that
      neither school is radically innovative, but both are employing “effective schools” research
      into their structure, leadership, and curriculum. Furthermore, the research explores change
      agent teachers, and their perspective on curriculum and school governance. This research seeks
      to suggest that educational innovation is temporal, and reforms are modified by what is
      sustainable over the long term.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>“Freedom” is a flexible and powerful word in the United States. Yet it has multiple,
      mutually exclusive definitions depending on who is invoking it and why. Franklin D.
      Roosevelt’s “freedom from want” in the New Deal era suggests something quite different from
      “freedom from taxes” espoused by politicians in the ‘90s. To identify the varieties of freedom
      and liberty in American presidential campaign discourse and differences across political
      parties and over time, I analyzed 88 speeches from 28 Republican and Democratic presidential
      nominating conventions (1952-2004). About half of the 760 terms were defined in opposition to
      foreign enemies (usually Communist), and very few were critical of liberty. Republicans used
      freedom terminology more often than Democrats, and there was evidence that the two parties
      defined freedom differently. I found no linear trends in the quantity or type of freedom usage
      over time, but there appeared to be cyclical rises and falls.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The relation between diet pill use and eating disorder (ED) diagnostic subtype,
      purging and compensatory behaviors, tobacco and substance use, personality characteristics,
      and Axis I and Axis II disorders was investigated. The sample included 1315 participants with
      ED diagnoses and diet pill use data from the multisite, Price Foundation Genetics Studies.
      Results indicated that diet pill use was associated with increased weight control behaviors,
      novelty seeking, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and borderline personality
      disorder, and negatively associated with narcissistic personality disorder. Findings suggest
      that certain clinical and personality variables distinguish individuals with EDs who use diet
      pills from those who do not. In the ED population, vigilant screening for diet pill use is an
      imperative clinical objective.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study examines the relationship between joint attention and imitation skills in
      preschoolers with autism by looking at a component skill within imitative behaviors: imitation
      of body movements, and its correlation with joint attention abilities. Based on a proposed
      model of social orienting, this study hypothesizes that imitation of body movements will be
      related to joint attention because both skill deficits require a child to focus attention
      towards another person. The deficit skill of children with autism to attend to another person
      is hypothesized to be at the core of social difficulties seen in these children, and therefore
      to account for deficits in both joint attention and imitation of body movements. If a
      relationship between joint attention and imitation of body movements is found, it will
      contribute to our understanding of social orienting as a construct underlying developmental
      processes in autism.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Previous research suggests the Ashe Metamorphic Suite (AMS) in northwestern North
      Carolina contains individual eclogite blocks which were entrained within an amphibolite-facies
      accretionary wedge. However, garnet inclusions within zircon from AMS amphibolite and
      amphibolite-facies biotite-hornblende gneiss preserve a record of near-peak eclogite-facies
      metamorphism. The Raman spectra from these garnet inclusions match a Raman spectrum from
      garnet inclusion within zircons in AMS eclogite. This indicates garnet inclusions from zircon
      in AMS amphibolite, biotite-hornblende gneiss, and eclogite have a similar composition forming
      under comparable P/T conditions. Inclusions in zircon from AMS eclogite include pyrope-rich
      garnet and omphacite, suggesting that zircon formed at near syn-peak eclogite-facies
      metamorphism. Therefore, growth of zircon in AMS amphibolite and biotite-hornblende gneiss
      occurred at near-eclogite facies conditions. These findings provide evidence that AMS
      eclogite, amphibolite, and biotite-hornblende gneiss once constituted a regional
      eclogite-facies terrane. This regional eclogite-facies terrane was likely exhumed by either
      extensional unroofing or slab extrusion.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Students with special needs increasingly are educated in the general classroom.
      Research suggests that teachers in the general education classroom often do not feel prepared
      to instruct students with special needs in their classrooms. This study used data from 2,961
      students in Wave 2 of the Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study (SEELS), collected
      by the U.S. Department of Education. Students in the sample were 7 to 14 years old and
      diagnosed with a variety of disabilities and included in the general classroom setting as part
      of their Language Arts instruction. This study examined the effects of teacher selfefficacy on
      the social skill development of students with special needs, and whether academic achievement
      mediated the relationship between teacher self-efficacy and student social skill development.
      Teacher self-efficacy, mediated by academic achievement, was found to predict student social
      skill development. Implications for future research and educational practice are discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study examines the effects of early Tudor reforms on the traditional models of
      masculinity of the sixteenth-century English nobility. It traces the origins of those models
      of proper manhood in literature and chronicle accounts, and then examines how those models
      were subtly refigured by the attempts of Henry VII and Henry VIII to control tournaments and
      castle building, two stages upon which nobles could perform their masculinity. The study finds
      that by stressing opulence over martiality in both cases, and by restricting the use of
      martial imagery to no other person but the crown, the Tudor kings contributed to an
      environment of change that allowed new models of masculinity, and in particular that of the
      polite gentleman, to develop.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Science education researchers have attempted descriptions of the relationship between
      science studies and science education. Such descriptions have applied the aggregate logic of
      literature reviews to the interpretive works of sociologists and anthropologists.
      Metaethnography (Noblit &amp; Hare, 1988) provides a framework for the synthesis of
      interpretive studies which may be more appropriate to describing the relationship between
      science education and science and technology studies. This project attempts to articulate that
      relationship further using Latour and Woolgar’s Laboratory Life, a seminal work in science
      studies, and Barton's Teaching Science For Social Justice, a study of the scientific practice
      of youth who live in homeless shelters. The meta-ethnographic synthesis reveals that the
      relationship between the two communities of scientific practice and the knowledge they use and
      produce does much to determine the form of that practice.</mods:abstract>

      Herald-Sun and The (Raleigh, N.C.) News &amp; Observer in coverage of same-sex marriage
      between January 1, 2004 and March 1, 2005. This study uses as its starting point a qualitative
      content analysis that found same-sex marriage articles in The News &amp; Observer tended
      to use a conflict frame, while articles at The Herald-Sun used an LGBT-celebratory frame. In
      this study, in-depth interviews were conducted with journalists from each paper who wrote or
      edited stories about same-sex marriage. Journalists were asked about their decision-making
      processes to determine why certain frames were used at each newspaper. While “news culture”
      factors such as news routines influenced perception of same-sex marriage as a conflict story
      at both newspapers, factors at the organizational level, such as newspaper resources and
      locations, ultimately had the most effect on framing.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper explores the function of Christian letters of recommendation, from the time
      of Paul (c. 50 CE) to the time of Emperor Julian (c. 350 CE). The first chapter provides
      background information concerning the function of letters of recommendation generally in
      antiquity. It is argued that the primary functions of such letters in Greco-Roman society was
      to provide hospitality for the traveler, and to testify to their trustworthiness. Where pagans
      used such letters for business or filial purposes, the early Christian church used them to
      build religious networks across the wide span of the Mediterranean world and the Levant. The
      second chapter of the thesis takes up the subject of hospitality practices in the Christian
      mission, and the third explores the use of letters of recommendation in the writings of the
      apostle Paul. Letters of recommendation were extremely important for the growth, spread and
      development of the Christian church.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The current study had two goals; first, the study examined the relations among stress,
      physical activity, and health symptoms in cancer survivors, and second this study attempted to
      psychometrically validate an electronic daily diary measure of stress, physical activity and
      health symptoms in cancer survivors (E-Diary-CS). Participants were 20 cancer survivors who
      provided daily self-report data on their current level of stress, health symptoms, and
      physical activity, for 3 weeks using the E-diary-CS. Results of linear regression indicated
      that higher levels of stress explained a significant amount of variance in health symptoms (R2
      = .215, p &lt; .05). Neither physical activity nor the interaction with stress predicted
      health symptoms. The association between well-validated, commonly used baseline measures and
      daily diary scores were moderate to strong and in the expected directions suggesting the
      Ediary-CS is a valid and reliable tool to assess stress, physical activity and health symptoms
      in cancer survivors.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Before reconstructing potential climate information preserved in Holocene
      archaeological shells of the European limpet, Patella vulgata, we studied the controls on
      delta18O and dela13C in modern specimens. We evaluated whether P. vulgata shells precipitate
      in isotopic equilibrium with the ambient water by comparing delta18OSHELL with expected
      values. Comparison revealed that delta18OSHELL values were 1.51 plus or minus 0.21 percent
      higher than expected (corresponding estimated SST was 6.5 plus or minus 2.5 degrees C lower
      than observed SST). However, an adjustment can account for this predictable vital effect to
      reliably reconstruct SST. Tropical species, P. stellaeformis, was evaluated to determine
      whether it displays a similar positive offset from equilibrium as P. vulgata. We tested the
      hypotheses that delta18OSHELL in tropical species displays vital effects and the
      disequilibrium would be constant and predictable. Our results indicated P. stellaeformis
      delta18OSHELL exhibits a negative offset from expected equilibrium. Differences in mineralogy
      or growth rates at different latitudes may influence mechanisms that cause vital effects.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The following discussion underlines the socio-political, geopolitical, and diplomatic
      factors that have directed, and continue to direct, French foreign policy in the Middle East.
      Paris’s diplomatic positions concerning the Middle East region during first five presidencies
      of the Fifth Republic will be examined extensively, in addition to an analytical
      representation of the development of contemporary French foreign policy itself. Furthermore,
      the electoral strength of French Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as the institutional
      realities of the Fifth Republic, will be investigated to exhibit which forces have yielded the
      most effect on Paris’s foreign policy framework. This thesis ultimately argues that France’s
      approach towards the Middle East, as well as Paris’s overall “Arab” policy, stems from a
      geopolitical strategy that has, overall, remained remarkably continuous since the de Gaulle
      administration, and it has maneuvered relatively independently of economic and domestic
      socio-political forces.</mods:abstract>

      sculpture of Palestinian synagogues as well as on Jewish sarcophagi. The buildings and

      Incident” described by the ancient historian, Josephus, in War 1.648-55 and Antiq. 17.151-63.
      Chapter four seeks to understand the meaning of the eagle-symbol within the literature
      familiar to Jews of late ancient Palestine. Chapter five presents the author’s interpretation
      of the eagle-symbol in both the sculptural remains and literary references. It considers the
      relationship of the image and meaning to Near Eastern and Byzantine art in light of the
      religious trends in late ancient Jewish society.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The cultural industries and policies of France are undergoing major changes due to
      increased globalization and Americanization of markets since the end of World War II. The
      trade related audiovisual policies France acribes can be seen as ineffective. What causes this
      I asserts is a combination cultural path dependancy and the growing need to react to global
      pressures. As it turns out the policies of France are motivated by both stated and unstated
      goals, rendering the policies unable to meet expectations. It is expected that until an
      alteration of goals or policies is made France will continue to experience poor performance
      regarding its trade related audiovisual policies.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Often, in the eutrophied subtropical lagoonal Neuse River Estuary, a relatively large
      proportion of the total phytoplankton is located in a compact area, the chlorophyll alpha
      maximum (Cmax). This productive zone was investigated using bioassays to determine its
      response to nutrient pulses (nitrogen and phosphorus) and as a conduit of trophic transfer to
      mesozooplankton, especially copepods. The Cmax and nearby waters generally were nitrogen
      limited. Both nitrogen and phosphorus addition caused phytoplankton carbon to nutrient molar
      ratios to decrease accordingly when that nutrient was limiting and often when it was not.
      Nauplii were identified as potentially important NRE grazers. Phytoplankton elemental content
      was found to influence trophic transfer, with high nutritional quality phytoplankton necessary
      for, but not guaranteeing, copepod success. Both nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment influenced
      copepod growth and abundance. In the context of water quality, relationships between
      eutrophication, phytoplankton distribution, copepod food quality, and carbon and nutrient fate
      are discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The many language attitude studies which have been conducted in the province of Québec
      over the past fifty years have revealed that the linguistic attitudes and beliefs of the
      Québécois towards both English and specific varieties of French have changed considerably. The
      purpose of the present study was to determine the current language attitudes of Québécois
      students towards standard Québec French and towards a colloquial variety of Québec French, le
      franco-québécois. In spite of the significant shift in language attitudes in Québec’s recent
      history, the results of this study were comparable to those of a similar study conducted three
      decades ago by Méar-Crine and Leclerc. In both studies, the majority of Québécois participants
      indicated a preference for the standard variety of Québec French.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study contributes to intervention literature by examining the role of economic
      interests on the decision to intervene in civil conflicts. Specifically this analysis
      addresses how the economic salience of a conflict or conflict country influences the decision
      by highincome OECD states to intervene either economically or militarily. Using ordered logit
      and multinomial logit models, this study finds that economic interests do influence the
      decision to intervene. The findings also indicate that economic salience does not affect
      intervention type equally. Higher levels of foreign direct investment was associated with a
      positive likelihood of utilizing military intervention and a negative likelihood of utilizing
      economic intervention. Trade and oil negatively affect the likelihood of military intervention
      while not having a significant effect on economic intervention.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>House members pursue multiple goals during their legislative career. The goals of
      reelection, good policy making and power affect member voting and committee composition. Yet
      in arguably a legislator’s most important choice, committee request, only the goal of
      reelection has empirical support. I argue that a member utilizes all three goals when going
      through the committee process and requests a committee assignment that will maximize their
      utility across all legislative goals. Utility maximization is achieved when a member can gain
      influence within a policy jurisdiction through leveraging their prior expertise. I employ a
      multinomial logit model in examining committee requests, for eight committees over fifty
      years. My findings indicate that across five of the eight committees a member’s prior
      occupation is a strong and consistent predictor of a legislator’s request. It is plausible,
      given the results that members pursue multiple goals in making their request for committee
      assignment.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Though the increasing influence of evangelical religion is often associated with
      participatory democracy, this thesis asserts that the rise of evangelicalism coincided with
      the establishment of planter hegemony. During the colonial period, many slaveowners in Chowan
      County North Carolina mixed civil and religious affairs in the Anglican Church. Slaveowners,
      however, felt threatened by parsons who attempted to preach to slaves. Former vestrymen and
      other slaveowners reluctantly accepted a popular movement for religious disestablishment they
      were unable to resist. The disestablishment of the Anglican Church had the effect of
      encouraging freer participation in religious fellowship, and slaveowners were even more
      fearful of the leveling impact of expanding participation in religious fellowship. By the
      1830s, however, the slaveowning white men held a disproportionate amount of authority within
      evangelical and orthodox churches. As a result, evangelical and Episcopal churches
      increasingly embodied the refined tastes of a minority of residents in Chowan County.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are differences in lower body
      power production gains between four weeks of complex and compound training. A secondary
      purpose was to determine whether differences in gains were observed at a faster rate between
      complex and compound training programs. Thirty one college-aged volleyball players were split
      into the groups based on gender and pre-training performance measures. Work was equated
      between the two groups. After 4 weeks of training, Both groups significantly improved (5-9%)
      their vertical jump height and power output following 3 weeks of training (p &lt; 0.0001).
      However, neither group improved significantly better than the other, nor did either group
      experience faster gains in vertical leap or power output. The results of this study suggest
      that performing 3-4 weeks of either complex or compound training is effective for improving
      vertical leap and power output; thus, coaches should choose the program which best suits their
      training schedules.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper examines the effects of migration on the well-being of migrants’ family
      members remaining in the country of origin. Previous literature discusses the processes of
      family separation and adjustment to new surroundings as being very trying for immigrants in
      host countries, but very few studies address the effects of migration on family members in
      home communities. Acknowledging the hardships faced by family members of migrants remaining at
      home, I use the Mexican Family Life Survey to empirically assess the effects of migration on
      the emotional well-being of migrants’ family members in Mexican communities of origin. Results
      indicate that the migration of close family members to the U.S., especially spouses and
      children, significantly increases the depressive symptoms and feelings of loneliness reported
      by family members remaining in Mexico. Women, especially mothers and wives, are the most
      adversely affected by family member migration.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Objective: To compare hip ROM, strength, muscle activity, and ankle dorsiflexion ROM
      between groups that demonstrate knee valgus during a squat task and those that do not
      (control). Also, determine if muscle activity changes after knee valgus is corrected by a
      twoinch heel block. Design: A single-session experimental research design was used to compare
      the control group and the valgus group. Participants: Seventeen (10 Females, 7 Males) control
      subjects (age[yr] = 23.82 {phono}{lstrok} 5.76, height[cm] = 166.12 plus or minus 31.13,
      weight[kg] = 69.59 plus or minus 15.37) and fourteen (12 Female, 2 Male) valgus subjects
      (age[yr] = 22.36 plus or minus 3.08, height[cm] = 167.21 plus or minus 9.3, weight[kg] = 65.93
      plus or minus 9.9) without lower extremity injury. Dependent Variables: Supine hip abduction
      and external rotation ROM. Ankle dorsiflexion ROM (straight and bent knee). Hip internal
      rotation, external rotation, extension, and abduction eccentric and concentric peak torque and
      time to peak torque. EMG mean amplitude of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius and adductor
      complex during a squat with and without a two inch heel block. Data Analysis: Mixed model
      analysis of variance tested for difference both between and within groups. Results: A
      significant group by phase interaction effect (p = 0.02) existed for mean adductor amplitude
      between the valgus and the control group. A significant difference (p &lt; .001) in
      straight knee ankle dorsiflexion ROM existed between the control and the valgus group. A
      significant difference (p = 0.034) existed between the internal rotation concentric time to
      peak torque between the two groups. Conclusion: The iii adductor complex plays a significant
      role in hip extension. Increased activity of the adductor during extension could pull the
      knees into valgus. Gastrocnemius tightness might contribute to knee valgus during a squat.
      There appears to be three distinct populations when considering this knee valgus squatting
      position. 1. Normal individuals who do not have valgus. 2. Ankle dysfunction individuals who's
      valgus position corrects with a heel block. 3. Hip dysfunction individuals who{99}s valgus
      position does not correct with a heel block.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Since the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority, the European Union has
      adopted a diplomatic mediating role in the region, highlighting that the resolution of the
      Israeli-Palestinian conflict is key to the development of the region. The European Union, as
      an international actor, has been committed to improving the humanitarian and economic
      situation of the Palestinian National Authority (PA) by the support of principles of building
      the institutions of a democratic, independent and viable Palestinian state, living in peace
      and security with Israel. The EU relations with the PNA have become more visible since the
      outbreak of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in 2000 due to stronger EU peace-keeping and development
      efforts through agreements and the formation of the “Quartet”. The EU has participated in
      bilateral and multilateral agreements in order to support the creation of a democratic PA. The
      European Union has influenced the PA to different extents. There have been clear boundaries to
      the full effectiveness of EU conditionality on the PA due to the nature of the agreements per
      se and due to the sui generis nature of the diplomatic relations between the EU and the PA.
      The advent of Hamas victory brings a new face to the EU-PA relations putting EU leverage in
      question.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis discusses the role of international actors in the post conflict elections
      in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It focuses mainly on the role of the Organization for Security and
      Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as well as the Office of the High Representative (OHR) in shaping
      the electoral system and influencing electoral politics through conflict management
      strategies. The main focus is placed on the entity parliamentary elections in 2000 and 2002 in
      order to assess the value and success of the conflict management strategies employed as well
      as the success of the international actors themselves. The thesis concludes that while
      international actors have been successful in producing a degree of stability in Bosnia since
      1995, they have been less successful in reducing the saliency of ethnic politics in elections
      and consequently the role of the major ethno-nationalist parties in the post-conflict
      political system.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this paper I will examine the role of education in determining the progress of
      economic development in Ireland and Spain after their respective ascensions to the European
      Union. Some factors to be examined in this study are a comparison of each country’s economic
      state at the time of EU integration, the rate and shape of progress since EU integration, the
      general role of education in economic development, and the influence of the European Union on
      education policy. I will then examine the specific effects of education on economic
      development in both Ireland and Spain. A theoretical framework provided by Joseph Stiglitz is
      used as the rationale behind this study, as he explains the purpose of reforming the education
      system and creating ‘knowledge capital’ in order to prepare for economic change. Finally, some
      comparisons will be made between the two countries to discern some general trends between
      education policy and successful economic development.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis focuses on security and defense policy between NATO, the European Union,
      and Russia in the period following the end of the Cold War and, in particular, the beginning
      of the 21st century. It looks at relations between the EU and Russia, NATO and Russia, and the
      EU and NATO in terms of the institutional framework and interests of each actor. It then goes
      on to examine the influence of Russian public opinion on foreign policy-making. The perceived
      discrepancy between Russian public opinion and policy regarding NATO and the European Union is
      examined here; that is, policy seems to favor NATO, while the public favors the EU. However,
      it will be proven that it is not so much a discrepancy as a utilization of organizations to
      put forward Russia’s interests, on which both the public and the policy elites agree.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis examines the role of European actors in the development of minority rights
      for the Hungarian minority in Romania. It focuses on the Organization for Security and
      Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe (COE), and the European Union (EU). The
      paper studies the minority rights norms that each body has established and their means of
      enforcing these norms. The paper uses Milada Vachudova’s “active leverage” theory as a
      theoretical framework to argue that it was the prospect of European Union membership that
      motivated Romania to establish a liberal minority rights regime. As a concluding and
      comparative element, the paper examines the Republic of Georgia as an example of a country
      with a tense minority situation, but one where EU membership is unlikely in the near future.
      The comparison strengthens the argument that the prospect of EU membership helped manifest a
      liberal minority rights regime in Romania.</mods:abstract>

      =520 \\$aHigh quality surface water is critical for maintaining healthy ecosystems and
      ensuring safe drinking water, yet is often compromised by point and non-point contamination
      sources. Failed septic systems, an example of non-point source pollution, may generate pools
      of untreated or minimally treated wastewater that can runoff into nearby streams. There are
      currently no means of quickly determining the impact of this pollution on surface water.
      Representative emerging contaminants (caffeine and triclosan) were targeted as indicators from
      failed septic systems and chlorination disinfection byproducts (haloacetic acids) for the
      effluent from conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants. Methods for the analysis of
      these compounds in various matrices were developed and applied to both effluent types and
      surrounding surface waters. Typical caffeine and triclosan concentrations in conventional
      municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents were 0.23micrograms/L and 0.3micrograms/L,
      respectively, as compared to 22micrograms/L and 7micrograms/L from septic tank effluents.
      Excitation-emission fluorescence spectrophotometry was also investigated as a tool for
      characterizing pollution from wastewater sources.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The Texas Commission for Environmental Quality has designed an unprecedented,
      market-based emissions reduction program to trade four highly reactive VOCs (HRVOCs) in the
      Houston/Galveston/Brazoria (HGB) area, one of the most polluted regions in the country. These
      compounds, ethylene, propylene, the isomers of butene, and 1,3- butadiene, can form ozone very
      rapidly and lead to Transient High Ozone Events that have dominated the Ozone Design Values in
      the HGB area for more than two decades. The EPA proposed approval of the HRVOC Emissions Cap
      and Trade program in 2005 as a means to help meet the one-hour ozone standard of 0.12 ppm.
      Under the current eight-hour ozone attainment standard of 0.08 ppm, concerns have surfaced
      regarding the program's effectiveness in helping to achieve said standard by the 2010
      deadline. Several policy implications of this uniquely complex program are examined against
      four other emissions trading programs and against uncertainties within the program itself.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This project was undertaken to determine how coastal land use and land cover affect
      dissolved nutrient concentration and form, phytoplankton abundance and community composition,
      and nitrogen buffering capacity in the non-tidal oligo- to meso-haline creeks of the Neuse
      Pamlico Estuarine System. The research included routine sampling of four estuarine creeks and
      seasonal in-situ nutrient addition bioassays designed to mimic nutrient loading events
      observed in the monitoring data. The results show the land use causing the greatest degree of
      disturbance (agriculture) resulted in the highest in-stream nutrient concentrations, the
      highest inorganic to organic nitrogen ratios, the lowest phytoplankton diversity, and
      decreased capacity to buffer the mainstem estuary from episodic nutrient loading. The findings
      underscore the need for watershed management designed to mitigate increased fresh water and
      nutrient loading from watershed modification upstream of estuarine creeks.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) are a long-term source of groundwater
      contamination. Difficulties of current remediation methods have led to the study of a novel
      brine barrier remediation technology (BBRT) which presents a solution to current limitations.
      This study utilized a mathematical model to advance understanding of BBRT at the macroscale. A
      subset of stochastic functions was employed to represent correlated random permeability fields
      and to asses their impacts on brine emplacement and brine removal efficiency. The injection of
      a highly viscous brine into the subsurface was seen to cause a decrease in permeability,
      leading to brine mounding around injection wells. For moderately heterogeneous domains, this
      behavior was able to be mitigated by the use of sufficiently low injection rates. However,
      local heterogeneities were shown to be the dominant factor in subsequent brine removal,
      emphasizing the importance of subsurface knowledge for accurate modeling and efficient
      implementation of BBRT.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Fluoroscopy-guided procedures utilizing x-rays may expose patients to radiation doses
      above the threshold for observable radiation-induced effects. Total fluoroscopy time is often
      available and serves as an indicator of skin dose. We conducted a retrospective review of
      fluoroscopy times for 225 procedures and identified ablations and biventricular (BIV) device
      implants as likely high-dose procedures, with mean fluoroscopy times of 62+48 minutes and
      51+28 minutes, respectively. To determine which variables best describe dose, we measured skin
      dose for thirty subjects using radiochromic dosimetry film and found mean doses of 133+94 rad
      and 164+176 rad for ablation and BIV procedures, respectively. We correlated dose to
      fluoroscopy time, weight, body mass index (BMI), the weight and time product, and the BMI and
      time product, and found the latter two correlate best with r-2 values of 0.41 and 0.36,
      respectively. Overweight patients appear to be at the greatest risk of receiving high skin
      doses.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>With the general inability of existing groundwater remediation techniques to
      efficiently remove dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) from the subsurface, a novel
      strategy known as the Brine Barrier Remediation Technique (BBRT) has been proposed as a
      potential alternative to currently used remedial strategies. However, there are still numerous
      open issues concerning this new technology including the complexities it introduces into
      contaminated systems that cause the analytical methods commonly used for system
      characterization to fail. New analytical methods were developed that were compatible with
      BBRT, and capable of quantifying the common groundwater contaminant, perchloroethene (PCE),
      chlorinated degradation products, and two surfactants, MA-80 and Triton X-100 often employed
      in remediation techniques. The developed methods were subsequently used to calculate mass
      balances for PCE and surfactant recovery within a field-scale implementation of the BBRT.
      Supplemental experiments were conducted to more closely examine the fate of unrecovered
      surfactants in the field system.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Little is known about the contribution of discriminatory healthcare experiences and
      healthcare provider distrust to racial/ethnic disparities in antiretroviral adherence among
      HIV+ patients. Among participants of the national HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study who
      completed three surveys over 12 months (n = 2267), I examined potential factors associated
      with discriminatory healthcare experiences and healthcare provider distrust. Among
      participants who reported antiretroviral therapy use at the last survey (n = 1911), I used
      structural equation modeling to test direct and indirect relationships among racial/ethnic
      minority status, discriminatory healthcare experiences, healthcare provider distrust, and
      medication adherence. I conceptualized minority status as a proxy for experiences with, and
      expectations about, racism in medicine. Attribution theory and models of antiretroviral
      therapy adherence informed the hypothesized relationships. Almost half (41%) the participants
      reported experiencing discrimination in healthcare settings, while few participants reported
      distrust of their healthcare providers. Factors associated with discrimination were being
      white (an unexpected finding), younger age, some college education, earlier HIV diagnosis,
      poorer self-reported physical health, AIDS diagnosis, ever having a CD4 count &lt; 200,
      any illicit drug use in the past year except heroin or cocaine, and less social support.
      Factors associated with distrust were younger age, some college education, poorer
      self-reported physical and mental health, higher viral load, drug use in the past year, less
      social support, and more discrimination. In the full structural equation model, the direct
      effect of minority status on adherence remained despite the presence of hypothesized
      mediators. The magnitude of indirect effects via discrimination, distrust, and medication
      efficacy beliefs was negligible, and their sum was not statistically significant. The effect
      of discrimination on adherence was entirely indirect via greater distrust and weaker
      medication efficacy beliefs. Greater distrust was unexpectedly associated with better
      adherence. Distrust indirectly affected adherence via participants' psychological distress
      about taking antiretroviral therapy and weaker medication efficacy beliefs. These findings
      offer partial support for the relationships posited among experiences and expectations of
      racism (as racial/ethnic minority status), discriminatory healthcare experiences, healthcare
      provider distrust, and antiretroviral therapy adherence. Future researchers should consider
      models with minority status as a contextual influence upon the hypothesized relationships.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Individual core values may be important to understanding and predicting behavioral
      decisions. This dissertation, presented in two manuscripts, examined the relationship between
      values and fruit and vegetable (FV) intake for colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors and
      non-affected persons. Hypotheses were tested using data from the North Carolina Strategies for
      Improving Diet, Exercise, and Screening (NC STRIDES) project, a population-based study of CRC
      risk prevention. Manuscript One describes the results of logistic regression analyses to
      evaluate whether values promote FV intake for 234 participants. Manuscript Two describes the
      results of casecomparison techniques to analyze counseling transcripts from 24 participants
      doing a values selfconfrontation exercise. Findings include: Manuscript One: All participants
      selected family, health, and God's will as the most frequently endorsed values. Compared to
      CRC survivors, non-affected persons were more likely to choose the values responsibility and
      friendship. Race, sex, baseline FV intake, and intervention group were not statistically
      associated with endorsing a particular value. Being a survivor did not predict selection of
      health as a value or selection of value type (instrumental values vs. terminal values). Being
      a nonsurvivor did predict increased FV intake at follow-up. Neither selecting instrumental
      values nor health predicted increased FV consumption. Selecting instrumental values was not
      predictive for reporting higher importance or self-efficacy for FV intake. Manuscript Two: The
      value health functioned to influence diet as: (1) a necessary component for other values, (2)
      a manifestation of God's will, and (3) a co-requisite value with responsibility for being in
      good health. Values functioned in both health promoting and limiting ways. For FV adherence,
      beliefs were more suggestive than categorizing participants based on values, sex, race, and
      CRC status. While logistic analyses provided no evidence supporting relationships between
      values and FV intake, case-comparison analyses underscore that values do influence diet. The
      values selfconfrontation served to raise participants' awareness about their value hierarchies
      and helped establish how values influence diet choices. Future research should explore
      ascribed meanings to values in tandem with how values relate to the health behavior of
      interest. Understanding how and which values influence health behavior practices can impact
      intervention design for cancer preventive behaviors.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Patients with advanced cancer often develop delirium (acute confusion), the prevalence
      rising to 90% in the final weeks of life. Age, illness severity, comorbidity, and preexisting
      cognitive impairment increase the risk of delirium, but despite its prevalence, little is
      known about delirium in older cancer patients. This three-phase study addresses the empirical
      gap in knowledge about delirium in older cancer patients. The first phase, a secondary
      analysis of data from studies of acute confusion in hospitalized elders, examined delirium and
      its etiology in 76 hospitalized older cancer patients, 10 of whom were near the end of life.
      The second phase comprised a pilot study of a home-based protocol to evaluate delirium in
      older adults with advanced cancer. The third phase was a descriptive, longitudinal, multiple
      case study of delirium and delirium vulnerability in seven older adults with advanced cancer
      near the end of life. The findings clarify the role of delirium in older cancer patients.
      Delirium occurred in all seven with advanced cancer (the three patients who died had
      reversible and terminal episodes of delirium; the four who lived each had one reversible
      episode). Delirium also was common in the hospitalized older cancer patients: 43 of 76 (56%)
      were delirious at some point during hospitalization; 8 of 10 (80%) who were near the end of
      life became delirious. Delirium resolved in 13 of the 43 (30%) hospitalized patients, but in
      30 (70%) delirium symptoms persisted at discharge. These older cancer patients were at risk
      for multiple etiologies of delirium: 90%, (including all near the end of life) had
      metabolic-nutritional risks, and hypoxic, orthostaticdehydration, and metabolic-toxic risks
      were common. Five of the hospitalized patients and one of the seven with advanced cancer had
      chronic cognitive impairment (all became delirious). Physical, behavioral, and physiological
      functioning in the older adults with advanced cancer declined before they became delirious.
      This decline in functioning may indicate diminishing reserve capacity, and suggests that early
      interventions aimed at specific etiologic risk factors may sustain reserve capacity and
      minimize delirium, thereby enhancing the quality of living and dying of older cancer patients,
      and minimizing distress for their caregivers.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is used often by women having treatment
      for breast cancer and has been studied extensively in European American, educated, affluent
      women. However, it is poorly understood in poor, uneducated, rural and African American women.
      Studies of folk medicine, spirituality and those few studies with ethnically diverse samples
      indicate that CAM is also used in these groups. The process by which women make decisions to
      use CAM during and after breast cancer treatment has not been clearly described. The aims of
      this study were to characterize CAM use during treatment for breast cancer in a sample of
      African American and Caucasian women; to examine precipitating and influential factors in
      Caucasian and African American women's choices to use CAM during breast cancer treatment; to
      describe the process and timing of decisions to use CAM; and to clarify the use of CAM for
      treatment of breast cancer related issues as compared to the use of CAM for maintaining and
      improving health. This exploratory descriptive study used a cross sectional design and
      multiple methods including a card sort, individual interviews and quantitative measures. A
      convenience sample of 19 African American and European American women participated, all of
      whom were CAM users and were receiving or recovering from breast cancer treatment. The women
      in the sample were generally educated beyond high school, were varied in age and income as
      well as type of residence (urban/rural). The results of this study indicate the importance of
      participant definitions of CAM. African American women in the sample reported higher use of
      CAM treatments than the European American women both for managing side effects of treatment
      and for their general health. The types of CAM treatments used by African American and
      Caucasian women were different. Having breast cancer motivated all the women to engage in a
      type of life review to search for reasons for having breast cancer and to affect adoption of
      healthy lifestyle choices in the form of CAM. These women used a process of deciding about CAM
      use that was shaped by people they considered to be experts, a variety of other information
      sources, their health beliefs and their own personal experiences with the CAM treatment. The
      decision to use CAM therapies involved weighing the pros and cons and trying out CAM therapies
      for their effectiveness. The importance of faith and spirituality, especially but not
      exclusively for African American breast cancer patients, was supported by these findings.
      Prayer was the CAM therapy chosen most often by all of the women in the sample. The study
      raises questions about literature indicating that women do not discuss CAM use with their
      health care providers. In fact, the findings indicate the importance of providers as a
      resource for patients considering CAM during treatment of breast cancer and the need for study
      of precise doses of CAM and conventional treatment given concurrently.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This research introduces a new statistical test for evaluating space-time clustering
      in data where exact location and time information are available for the points of interest
      (cases). The test statistic, DP, is defined as the length of the path from X[1] to X[n] when
      the n cases are ordered by time of occurrence. Significance of the test is most appropriately
      determined by comparing the directed path length of the data to the empirical distribution of
      lengths obtained from all possible orderings of the n cases, or a random subset of those
      orderings when n is large. The first three moments of DP are developed, and its properties are
      investigated using simulation on clustered and unclustered data. DP is then compared with
      Knox's test and Mantel's Generalized Regression using simulation on clustered and unclustered
      data. Two data sets from the literature (fifteen years of Burkitt's Lymphoma data from Uganda,
      and three years of birth defect data from California) are then used to compare the performance
      of these tests on actual data. This work was largely done as this author's dissertation under
      the competent, inspirational, and greatly appreciated advisement of Professor Emeritus Dana
      Quade, Department of Biostatistics, UNC-Chapel Hill.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Asthma is a complex genetic disorder with environmental influences and is
      characterized by airway inflammation, reversible airflow obstruction, and airway
      hyperresponsiveness (AHR). The arachidonic acid metabolite thromboxane A2 (TXA2), is a potent
      lipid mediator released by platelets and inflammatory cells and is capable of inducing
      bronchoconstriction. In the airways, it has been postulated that TXA2 causes airway
      constriction by direct activation of TP receptors on airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. Here we
      demonstrate that although TXA2 can mediate a dramatic increase in ASM constriction, this
      response is largely dependent on vagal innervation of the airways and is highly sensitive to
      muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonists. Further analyses demonstrate that
      TP-dependent ASM constriction requires M3 mAChR expression. To further define the mechanism
      underlying TXA2 meditated airway constriction, mice carrying a Tp receptor locus that is
      sensitive to disruption by cre recombinase were generated. These mice were crossed with
      nestin-cre transgenic mice, which express cre recombinase throughout the nervous systems. Here
      we demonstrate that loss of the TP receptor throughout the nervous system does not
      significantly affect TXA2 airway reactivity. To assess ASM TP receptor function, we crossed
      the floxed Tp receptor mice with SM22-cre transgenic mice, which express cre recombinase in
      smooth muscle. The resultant smooth muscle TP receptor deficient animals demonstrate
      attenuated airway responses following aerosol challenges with TXA2. Together, these findings
      suggest that TXA2 mediates airway reactivity and AHR through collaborations between ASM Tp
      receptors and the M3 mAChR. In addition to TXA2, we also evaluated the role of NPSR1 (GPRA), a
      newly deorphanized G protein-coupled receptor that has been shown to be a promising candidate
      gene associated with asthma in human populations. We report here that the change in airway
      resistance in response to methacholine was identical in control and NPSR1 deficient mice and
      the development of allergic lung disease in NPSR1 deficient mice is unaltered. In contrast to
      previously published data, our analyses also failed to detect expression of NPSR1 in human
      lung tissue or in mice with allergic lung disease. Taken together, our studies fail to support
      a direct contribution of NPSR1 to asthma pathogenesis.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In the somatosensory cortex, minicolumns have previously been shown to not only be
      cortical structures, but to be functional entities as well. However, research of their
      functional role in cortical information processing has been limited. The main focus of the
      research in this manuscript was to assess and quantify the information processing role of the
      minicolumn in the evoked cortical response. More specifically, the evoked minicolumnar spatial
      pattern in SI in a number of stimulus conditions is evaluated. Differences in evoked
      minicolumnar spatial patterns were examined by evaluation of the change in the stimulus
      parameters, such as stimulus site location, amplitude, and frequency, needed to evoke a just
      noticeable difference in the evoked minicolumnar spatial pattern. Through the use of OIS
      imaging techniques, OIS images for both in vitro and in vivo assays were collected and
      analyzed. Data analyses revealed that evoked minicolumnar spatial patterns in SI and the
      sensorimotor cortical slice do contain information that can be correlated to stimulus
      conditions, and these evoked minicolumnar patterns are time-dependent, stimulus specific, and
      reproducible.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The Teachable Moment (TM) model suggests that there are certain times when an
      individual is especially ready to change behavior and thus, especially open to receiving
      messages about behavior change. According to the TM model, experiences that jointly 1)
      increase risk perceptions, 2) prompt concordant emotional responses, and 3) impact
      self-concept may offer a powerful motivational context for promoting behavior change. Further,
      tailoring smoking cessation interventions on TM components may increase the salience of health
      messages. The TM model was used to examine desire to quit smoking among family members of lung
      cancer patients. Further, the relationship between desire to quit and engagement with and
      reactions to self-help smoking cessation materials was examined. Participants were family
      members of lung cancer patients recruited for a randomized controlled trial testing a
      counseling intervention for smoking cessation. Study results indicate that components of the
      TM model were related to desire to quit in family members of lung cancer patients.
      Specifically, increased perceived risk, negative self image, and high subjective norm for
      quitting were related to high desire to quit. Nonwhites were more likely to have a high desire
      to quit than whites. There was a significant interaction between worry and gender, such that
      women with low worry were less likely to have a high desire to quit than were men and women
      with high worry. Findings on engagement with and reactions to materials were mixed. Engagement
      with materials was not related to baseline desire to quit, but was related to positive
      reactions to the materials. Those with a higher desire to quit were more likely to report that
      the information in the tailored booklet applied to them, and was new to them, interesting,
      trustworthy, and moving. Finally, family members with a higher desire to quit were more likely
      to say that the information in the booklet make them want to quit smoking. Evidence from this
      initial study indicates that the TM model provides a strong conceptual framework for 1)
      identifying specific determinants of desire to quit among family members of lung cancer
      patients; and 2) developing effective tailored self-help materials for this population.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Ethanol exposure induces profound disruptions in developing organisms, but the
      period(s) of maximal susceptibility for these effects are not clearly defined. The overall
      hypothesis of this dissertation was that the timing of developmental ethanol exposure would
      influence manifestations of ethanol toxicity in medaka. Hatching success and morphometric
      measures of medaka growth and development were used to assess the dose-response for
      developmental ethanol toxicity. Specifically, medaka embryos were exposed to a range of
      sublethal ethanol concentrations (0.1, 0.5, to 1.0 % about equal to 17.2, 86, or 172 mM)
      during early, middle or late development in order to address temporal variations in
      sensitivity. Ethanol-induced decreases in total body length were found to be most severe with
      increasing ethanol concentrations that occurred either early or late in embryonic development,
      whereas head width was consistently decreased at all ethanol concentrations, regardless of
      developmental timing. These effects were accompanied by dose-related decreases in hatching
      success which were more pronounced with ethanol exposures that occurred early in development.
      Subsequent analyses of time-dependent changes in brain growth and caspase-3/7 activation were
      used to address the neurodevelopmental consequences of ethanol exposure. In these studies,
      medaka embryos were exposed to 1% ethanol during early, middle or late development and
      evaluated for treatment-related changes in brain volume and caspase-3/7 activation on day 9
      postfertilization. Interestingly, the pattern of sensitivity observed for ethanol-induced
      decreases in total brain volume was similar to that seen with ethanol-induced decreases in
      somatic growth; embryos treated either early or late in development were most severely
      affected. Treatment-related decreases in caspase-3/7 activity were independent of
      developmental timing. In general, these data show that the sensitivity to developmental
      ethanol exposure varies according to both the timing of exposure and the endpoint used to
      assess toxicity.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This present study deals with designing a real-time remote handheld ECG monitoring
      system and evaluating its potential usefulness in early detection of heart conduction
      problems. The raw ECG recordings were sent by the handheld monitor (client) to a remote
      server, which performed an on-line ECG analysis and sent the results back to the client.
      Real-time feedback provided to the client included display of ECG, results of ECG analysis and
      alarms (if required). The objective of this work was to determine its effectiveness in
      real-time identification of particular pattern preceding ventricular fibrillation. The remote
      server identified the occurrence of QRS complex and premature ventricular contractions and
      monitored ECG for ventricular tachycardia and variations in heart rate variability indices.
      The sensitivity and specificity of the QRS detection to ECG recordings from MIT-Arrhythmia
      database were 99.34% and 99.31%, respectively. Similarly these parameters of the premature
      ventricular contraction detection were 87.5% and 91.67%, respectively. The time between alarm
      and the onset of ventricular fibrillation was measured on ECG recordings where premature
      ventricular contractions were found to lead to ventricular fibrillation. The remote monitor
      was able to successfully identify the onset on ventricular fibrillation. Early detection could
      contribute to better response to an emergency intervention. HRV indices sensitive to the
      differences between normal and subjects with congestive heart failure were monitored in
      real-time. They were heart rate, statistical index RMSSD, total spectral power, high frequency
      power and the ratio of low frequency to high frequency power (LFP:HFP). The effectiveness of
      HRV indices was tested on an ECG recording of a sleep study subject, who experienced cardiac
      arrhythmia. Cyclic changes observed in total spectral power prior to onset of cardiac
      arrhythmia could be attributed to REM sleep cycles. No other conclusive change in HRV indices
      was observed. The monitor's usefulness in predicting long-term prognosis of post-MI subjects
      was tested on ECG recordings from two subjects made immediately after conclusion of cardiac
      arrhythmia and during a follow-up visit. Both showed higher RMSSD, total spectral power and
      LFP:HFP ratio. Personalizing the monitor for each patient further improves its accuracy in
      measurement of various parameters.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Exercise intervention studies among leukemia patients have previously been very
      limited. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to examine the effects of an individualized
      prescriptive exercise intervention, administered in-hospital during the treatment-recovery of
      leukemia patients, on fitness parameters and quality of life. Five patient volunteers were
      recruited for the subject, and four successfully completed the six-week training protocol,
      which consisted of aerobic activity between 40-60% of heart rate reserve, endurance-based
      resistance training, and flexibility training. Physiological and psychological parameters were
      assessed within three days of the induction phase of chemotherapy, and again at the end of the
      fourth week of recovery. Non-significant differences were observed for every variable, leading
      researchers to believe all parameters were maintained throughout the six-week exercise
      training protocol. The results of this study demonstrate that an exercise program, consisting
      of aerobic training, resistance training, and flexibility training, enables acute leukemia
      patients to maintain physiology and quality of life while undergoing chemotherapy.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In order to examine ethnic differences in pain sensitivity 51 African Americans (24
      men, 27 women) and 55 individuals from Other ethnic groups (primarily Caucasian; 26 men, 29
      women) were tested for pain sensitivity to ischemia, heat, and cold pressor tests after both
      mental stress and rest. Resting and stress-induced blood pressure (BP), plasma norepinephrine
      (NE), and cortisol were assessed. African Americans had lower pain tolerance relative to
      Caucasian/Others for all pain tests. Only the Caucasian/Other group showed the expected
      inverse relationship between BP and pain sensitivity. African Americans exhibited lower
      cortisol concentrations overall and blunted NE and systolic BP responses to stress. Only in
      Caucasians/Others was the relationship seen between higher stress-induced BP, cortisol, and NE
      levels and greater pain tolerance. The results suggest that there are alterations in
      endogenous pain regulatory mechanisms in African Americans, which may contribute to their
      greater rate of clinical pain symptoms.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this paper, I use acoustic phonetic data to examine the phenomenon of nasal
      coarticulation in French. Previous work describes French as a language with very little
      vowel-nasal (VN) coarticulation, presumably due to the oral/nasal contrast in vowels (Cohn
      1990). However, I found that the high vowel /i/, which has no nasal counterpart in French,
      exhibits a high degree of coarticulation This finding supports the proposal that contrast and
      coarticulation are inversely correlated (Manuel 1990), adding the insight that this
      correlation is observable even within a language. Based on this finding and a typological
      survey of VN coarticulation, I propose an underspecification account in an Optimality
      Theoretic framework to capture the patterns of VN coarticulation. In this OT account, the
      interaction of markedness constraints driving orality and minimizing effort and a faithfulness
      constraint protecting the feature [+ nasal] provides an explanation for the French data and
      produces the attested typology.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper investigates the impact of culture change on the Yakut, an indigenous
      population in Siberia. Variation in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was compared for two
      grouping variables of residency status (urban/rural and isolated/not isolated) and between the
      sexes. Rural and isolated residents exhibited significantly higher mean systolic blood
      pressure values than their urban and not isolated counterparts. Diastolic blood pressure was
      found to be significantly elevated for isolated residents. There was no significant difference
      in diastolic blood pressure between rural and urban residents. Men had higher mean systolic
      and diastolic blood pressure than women. Age and three measures of adiposity were also
      incorporated into the analysis. The relationship between these measures and blood pressure was
      evaluated. These results indicate traditional theories of modernization are insufficient when
      attempting to conceptualize the unique experience of Siberians. Culture change may be a more
      accurate framework in which to evaluate this phenomenon.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Twenty-six women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and 39 non-PMDD women
      were tested for allopregnanolone (ALLO) responses to mental stress. Fourteen PMDD and 17
      non-PMDD women had a history of depression (DEP), though all were free of current psychiatric
      illness. Women with prior DEP showed a blunted ALLO stress response and failed to show a
      decrease from venipuncture to baseline compared to women with no prior DEP. Women with prior
      DEP did not show the correlation between progesterone and ALLO that was seen in those with no
      prior DEP. ALLO levels at baseline and blunted ALLO reactivity predicted more severe
      premenstrual symptoms, but only in PMDD women with prior DEP. These results suggest that prior
      DEP is associated with a failure of ALLO to be appropriately responsive to challenge, with
      alterations in the conversion of progesterone to ALLO, and link ALLO to symptoms in PMDD women
      with prior DEP.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders encompass a variety of structural and behavioral
      abnormalities attributable to maternal alcohol consumption. This study was designed to
      investigate the mechanistic and pathogenic role of retinoic acid (RA) in the genesis of
      ethanol-induced forelimb defects. The mouse limb bud has proven to be an ideal model with
      which to study effects of ethanol because its development is more thoroughly understood than
      other regions or organ systems. The hypothesis that RA-deficient mouse embryos/fetuses
      manifest similar limb defects and distal limb cell death patterns to those of ethanol treated
      dams was tested. A RA receptor (RAR) antagonist and an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor
      produced limb malformations consistent with those following ethanol exposure. Similarly, cell
      death was observed in the same region of the limb following exposure to each chemical.
      Secondly, the hypothesis that exogenous RA can prevent ethanol-induced cell death in the limb
      was tested. A subteratogenic dose of RA was co-administered with ethanol. Limb buds exposed to
      ethanol and RA exhibited low levels of distal limb cell death, comparable to control limbs,
      demonstrating that RA acts antagonistically to ethanol in the limb and suggesting that ethanol
      interferes with RA-mediated development. Also, in support of this premise, the results of in
      situ hybridization analysis reveal that ethanol represses RA-dependant gene expression in the
      limb at 8 and 18 hours, post treatment. Importantly, however, microarray examination of limb
      buds within 2-6 hours of ethanol exposure revealed no correlation between the transcriptional
      changes induced by ethanol and the RAR antagonist. The lack of early RA-mediated gene changes
      following ethanol exposure indicates that perturbation of RA-dependant developmental pathways
      is NOT a proximate teratogenic effect of ethanol. Significant changes in cellular functions
      and pathways were evident shortly after ethanol exposure, suggesting several possible
      mechanisms of ethanol teratogenesis that merit future investigation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Among young adults, chlamydial infection is the most common bacterial sexually
      transmitted infection. Women and minorities are most affected. Screening rates are low despite
      recommendations for yearly testing. Programs to expand testing to community settings may
      increase screening rates. To examine this and other questions, we conducted a cross-sectional
      analysis of Wave III of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (April 2, 2001 -
      May 9, 2002). Chlamydia trachomatis test results were available for 10,928 (88.6%) of the
      sexually experienced participants. First, we developed selective screening guidelines for
      community settings. Separately for women and men, we developed three predictive models using
      unconditional multiple logistic regression. The initial models included predictor
      characteristics plus information on 1) respondent's race/ethnicity; or 2) respondent's most
      recent partner's race/ethnicity; or 3) no information on race/ethnicity. A combination of
      characteristics provides potentially useful screening tools. Applying these models to select _
      50 percent of the population for diagnostic testing identifies approximately 80 percent of
      infections in women and men. Using race/ethnicity in any screening algorithm is controversial
      and may have significant consequences. The model without race information, however, resulted
      in many missed diagnoses in the minority group. Universal screening for chlamydial infection
      may be the only approach that reaches high prevalence populations while avoiding the stigma of
      screening guidelines incorporating race/ethnicity. Second, we evaluated the association
      between partner age difference and chlamydial infection among young women. Adolescent girls
      with older male partners are at higher risk of STI compared to girls with partners their own
      age, but whether this association continues beyond adolescence is unclear. After multiple
      logistic regression, the odds of prevalent chlamydial infection among women with partners two
      to eight years younger were nearly two times greater (odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) 0.9 - 3.5) than partners within one year's age. Among women with older partners,
      the adjusted odds of infection were similar for partners two to five years older (OR 1.4, 95%
      CI 0.9 - 2.3) and partners six to 36 years older (OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9 - 2.8). Among young adult
      women, older partners are moderately associated with prevalent chlamydial infection.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Objective: To examine the effects of strength training on lower extremity joint
      kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activation. Design and Settings: A randomized controlled
      experimental design was employed. Subjects performed 5 stop-jump tasks and 3-maximum voluntary
      isometric contraction (MVIC) tasks before and after completing either a 9-week lower extremity
      strength training program (intervention) or 9-weeks of abstinence from strength training
      (control). Subjects: A total of 66 females who were healthy, recreational athletes were
      randomly assigned to either the intervention (n=33, age=22.5±2.3 yrs, ht=1.67 plus or minus
      .07 m, wt=63.5 plus or minus 9.2 kg) or control (n=33, age=22.5 plus or minus 3.8 yrs, ht=1.67
      plus or minus .06 m, wt=61.1 plus or minus 8.35 kg) group. Measurements: Three-dimensional
      videography, force plates, and telemetry EMG were used to record kinematic, kinetic, and
      muscle activation data during the stop-jump task. A hand-held dynamometer was used to collect
      the MVIC strength data. Dependent variables included knee anterior shear force (K-ASF); knee
      flexion, hip flexion, and knee valgus joint angles at K-ASF; knee extension, hip flexion, knee
      valgus, and hip abduction moments at K-ASF, and preparatory (200msec prior to footstrike) and
      landing phase EMG amplitudes of the vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, rectus femoris, biceps
      femoris, medial hamstrings, gluteus medius, and gluteus maximus. MVIC strength for quadriceps,
      hamstrings, gluteus medius, and gluteus maximus were also assessed. Statistical analyses were
      performed using a 2 [group] X 2 [time] repeated-measures ANOVA (alpha&lt;.05). Post-hoc
      t-tests were performed to investigate significant interactions. Results: The intervention
      group increased in MVIC strength subsequent to the strength training protocol (p&lt;.001
      for all muscles). However, intervention group EMG amplitudes decreased in the vastus lateralis
      (p=.002), vastus medialis (p=.001), and rectus femoris (p=.004) during the preparatory phase
      and in the vastus lateralis (p=.008) during the landing phase. No significant differences were
      observed in subject kinetics or kinematics. Conclusions: The results indicate that a 9-week
      single-modality intervention program based on strength training is not sufficient to alter
      neuromuscular characteristics in female recreational athletes. Subject muscular strength
      increased significantly, but subjects may be compensating by decreasing muscle activation
      thereby maintaining similar motion kinetics and kinematics. Further research is needed to
      investigate the effects of strength training in different populations and in combination with
      other intervention modalities.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Soil organic matter (SOM), especially humic substances and biological material,
      profoundly affect polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) movement, toxicity, and degradation when
      assessing acceptable end points for in situ remediation practices. The complex,
      inter-dependent relationship between soil chemical and physical attributes makes determining
      absolute PAH fate, transport, and availability a formidable task. This research attempted to
      correlate the impact known SOM components have on pyrene sorption as related to sorbent
      loading and type and mineral phase aggregation. The objective was achieved by generating a
      synthetic soil, composed of mineral matter, humic acid (HA), and peptidoglycan (PG), and
      comparing this matrix to freshly contaminated and aged natural soils, using pyrene as the
      representative hydrophobic organic contaminant. In contrast to HA, a larger concentration of
      PG sorbed to both mineral phases (hematite and montmorillonite clay); thus, promoting further
      particle aggregation, and effectually resulting in greater pyrene sorption as evidenced by
      HPLC and fluorescence microscopy. The greater the concentration and number of constituents
      introduced into the synthetic matrix, culminating in a HA+PG mixture loaded onto clay, the
      greater the resulting pyrene sorption and similarity to spiked natural soils, both in chemical
      and physical attributes. The final result was a compiled fluorescence map visually detailing
      pyrene location and percentage sorbed in relation to PG, HA, and the mineral phases for
      natural and synthetic soils, where the biological constituent held a significant influence
      over pyrene compared to that by the humic substances. In summary, the type and concentration
      of SOM constituents, specifically humic substances and biological material, sorbed to a
      mineral phase significantly impact soil physical and chemical characteristics, and therefore,
      should be accounted for when determining pyrene fate, transport, and availability within
      contaminated soil systems. Potentially, when these observations are combined with fluorescence
      microscopy, consultants could determine the most effective remediation technology to target
      specific locations, such as pore spaces, or strong sorptive entities, such as PG, and achieve
      acceptable end-points.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>DNA mismatches are generated when heteroduplexes formed during recombination involve
      DNA strands that are not completely complementary. I used tetrad analysis in Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae to examine the meiotic repair of a base-base mismatch and a four-base loop in a
      wild-type strain and in strains with mutations in genes implicated in DNA mismatch repair.
      Efficient repair of the base-base mismatch required Msh2p, Msh6p, Mlh1p, and Pms1p, but not
      Msh3p, Msh4p, Msh5p, Mlh2p, Mlh3p, Exo1p, Rad1p, Rad27p, or the proofreading exonuclease of
      DNA polymerase delta. Efficient repair of the four-base loop required Msh2p, Msh3p, Mlh1p, and
      Pms1p, but not Msh4p, Msh5p, Msh6p, Mlh2p, Mlh3p, Exo1p, Rad1p, Rad27p, or the proofreading
      exonuclease of DNA polymerase delta. I find evidence that a novel Mlh1p-independent complex
      competes with an Mlh1p-dependent complex for the repair of a four-base loop. I also found that
      the frequency and position of local double-strand DNA breaks affect the ratio of mismatch
      repair events that lead to gene conversion versus restoration of Mendelian segregation.
      Mutations in POL30, which encodes PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) in S. cerevisiae,
      increase the rate of mutations in vegetative cells. Collaborators found that mitotic
      recombination between homeologous sequences is slightly elevated in pol30-52 and pol30-201
      strains. I showed that repair of base-base mismatches generated during meiotic recombination
      is decreased in both pol30 mutants; however, the repair defect associated with the hypomorphic
      pol30 mutants is not as severe as that observed when MSH2 is deleted. Aberrant segregation and
      crossovers are also decreased in the pol30 mutants. To address the role of ATP
      binding/hydrolysis in MMR-related processes, I examined mutations known to compromise the
      ATPase activity of Pms1p and Mlh1p. The results of these analyses confirm a differential
      requirement for the Pms1p ATPase activity in replication vs. recombination processes, while
      demonstrating that the Mlh1p ATPase activity is important for all examined MMR-related
      functions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This project sought to understand how novel receptor mechanisms might play a role in
      the atypicality of antipsychotic drugs (APDs). The specific focus was on D2 receptor
      "functional selectivity," the phenomenon by which some ligands selectively
      activate D2-mediated functional pathways. The first studies examined the effects of a group of
      chemically diverse atypical antipsychotic drugs on the D2L-mediated activation of MAP kinase
      phosphorylation and of arachidonic acid release. These studies indicate that only aripiprazole
      showed partial intrinsic activity at both functional endpoints, whereas all other atypicals
      were neutral antagonists. Further study of aripiprazole demonstrated unique D2 binding
      characteristics and no capacity to initiate D2 receptor internalization. Next, site-directed
      mutagenesis of three transmembrane 5 (TM 5) helix serines (i.e., S5.42A, S5.43A, and S5.46A)
      was used to study how these residues affected the actions of aripiprazole and other typical
      partial D2 agonists. These residues play key roles in catecholamine-receptor binding and
      activity at multiple D2-mediated pathways in CHO cells, and my data illustrate that
      non-catechols with partial intrinsic activity are uniquely regulated by these serines compared
      to classical agonists. Finally, a D2L receptor transfected-dopaminergic cell line (N27-D2L)
      was examined as an in vitro dopaminergic neuronal model. The goal was to use this cell line to
      study atypical APDs for characterization of their intrinsic activity at D2L-mediated functions
      (e.g., dopamine uptake and release) at which certain drugs have differential effects in situ.
      Although these cells initially appeared to be promising dopaminergic models (i.e., they
      synthesized dopamine, expressed the dopamine transporter, and the transfected D2L receptors
      coupled to adenylate cyclase), their utility was limited by the fact that dopamine uptake and
      release, as well as D2L receptor internalization, were not measurable using the methodologies
      we employed. My data support the hypothesis that at least one major drug (aripiprazole) has
      unique D2L receptor binding and activating properties that cannot be accommodated by
      traditional pharmacological theory. In addition, aripiprazole and other functionally selective
      compounds can be important probes to further our understanding of ligand-receptor
      interactions, and how this leads to functional changes. This work also suggests reexamination
      of some current philosophies for rational drug discovery.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Alcoholism is a tremendous health problem throughout the world. Ethanol is a unique
      drug that is consumed in large quantities for pharmacologic effect, reaching blood
      concentrations as high as 100mM. Ethanol is eliminated almost exclusively via oxidation to
      acetate in the liver, and nearly all of the ethanol-derived acetate is released into the blood
      where it travels to other organs, including the brain, for use as an energy source. Thus
      ethanol directly alters metabolism in the liver, and causes the production of large amounts of
      acetate which may serve as a substrate for brain, possibly contributing to intoxication and
      dependence. This dissertation describes two separate approaches to study the metabolic effects
      of ethanol. First, 1H NMR-based metabolomic analysis of endogenous metabolites revealed
      decreased lactate and alanine, and increased acetate and ketone bodies due to ethanol. These
      results provided new insights regarding the effect of ethanol on gluconeogenesis. In addition,
      we determined that ethyl glucuronide (EtG), a unique metabolite of ethanol, produces a
      characteristic NMR signal. EtG is formed within hours of ethanol dosing, and remains elevated
      during a 4 day binge exposure. The antioxidant BHT appears to reduce formation of EtG during a
      4 day exposure to ethanol. Our second approach used 13C-enriched tracers along with 13C NMR to
      measure brain metabolism of ethanol-derived acetate. Our hypothesis was that cerebral
      metabolism of acetate released from the liver during ethanol oxidation perturbs cerebral
      metabolism, and thereby contributes to neuroadaptation associated with alcohol dependence and
      withdrawal. Using a single dose of [2-13C] ethanol intragastrically, we found carbons derived
      from ethanol are rapidly incorporated into brain amino acids glutamate, glutamine, and GABA.
      Next, we investigated whether a 10 day exposure to ethanol would increase cerebral utilization
      of acetate. We found that acetate metabolism was not increased, most likely because transport
      into brain astrocytes was not increased. We did find, however, that ethanol induced
      significant changes in metabolism of GABA, and we speculate that this may reflect
      neuroadaptations that produce tolerance to ethanol.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Rates of childhood overweight in the United States continue to rise at a steady and
      disconcerting pace. Childhood overweight is associated with a variety of adverse health
      consequences for children and the need to intervene is an important public health goal.
      Environmental interventions that promote healthy weight in young children may help prevent and
      mitigate childhood overweight, since eating and physical activity habits are established early
      in childhood and tend to track into adulthood. A large percentage of children spend time in
      child care, and duration of time in care has increased in recent years. Child care facilities
      may serve as a home-away-from-home setting, where children learn and adopt early nutrition and
      physical activity behaviors. Thus, child care providers can encourage healthy eating and
      promote regular physical activity for young children. The child care setting provides a unique
      opportunity to address healthy weight in children, but intervention efforts that target both
      nutrition and physical activity environment, policies, and practices are needed to support
      child level change. However, few preschool interventions have addressed nutrition and physical
      activity, although interest is growing in this area. The overarching goal of this dissertation
      was to promote the health of young children in child care through a nutrition and physical
      activity environmental intervention. This dissertation consisted of three distinct projects
      including pilot testing of a recently developed nutrition and physical activity environmental
      intervention; comparison of two methods to train community health professionals to deliver the
      intervention; and assessment of the reliability (test-retest and inter-rater) and validity of
      the self-assessment instrument which was a key component of the intervention.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Hydrophilic molecules do not easily cross the intestinal epithelium. One approach to
      improve intestinal absorption of hydrophilic compounds is to reversibly modulate tight
      junctions by co-administration of a paracellular permeability enhancer (PPE). Currently, there
      is no enhancer that has shown sufficient potency or sufficiently low toxicity to be used for
      this purpose in humans. The potency of PPEs is routinely assessed in vitro using cell
      monolayers. However, in vitro potency determinations typically underestimate the
      concentrations of PPEs that are required to improve the intestinal absorption of hydrophilic
      compounds in animals. Studies in this work demonstrated that components present in intestinal
      fluid, when introduced to cell monolayers, substantially reduced the potency of amphiphilic
      PPEs by sequestration in mixed micelles of intestinal fluid. Addition of serum on the
      basolateral side, to simulate the presence of blood components on the serosal side of the
      intestinal epithelium, had only a modest impact on PPE potency. Agitation of cell monolayers,
      representing intestinal motility, increased the apparent potency of amphiphilic PPEs, by
      reducing the height of the unstirred water layer. Therefore, incorporation of 1) components of
      intestinal fluid and 2) features of intestinal motility into the cell culture model are
      recommended for improved predictivity of PPE potency. A major concern affecting the use of
      PPEs in humans is that theymay increase the risk of systemic exposure of toxins, though this
      has not been studied directly. In this work, the model amphiphilic PPE,
      hexadecylphosphocholine, was found to increase the in vitro flux of lipopolysaccharide across
      Caco-2 cells, but only at relatively toxic concentrations, as measured by a novel quantitative
      histological technique. After transient intestinal administration of the minimum effective
      dose of hexadecylphosphocholine to rats, marked intestinal damage was observed, but no
      evidence for systemic absorption of lipopolysaccharide was found. These studies provide
      evidence that even at high doses of PPEs that might cause some intestinal damage, significant
      amounts of lipopolysaccharide are not absorbed. The results obtained in this study challenge
      the current dogma that intestinal absorption enhancers are likely to cause systemic exposure
      to microbial toxins and resultant toxicity by compromising the intestinal epithelial barrier.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Large hurricanes have profound impacts on temperate forests, but owing to their
      infrequent nature these effects rarely have been examined in detail. In 1996 Hurricane Fran
      significantly damaged many long-term census plots in Duke Forest in Piedmont North Carolina,
      thereby providing a unique research opportunity. I combined over 20 years of prehurricane and
      five years of post-hurricane data on individual trees, seedlings and saplings to determine how
      hurricanes affect forest structure, diversity, and succession. Several plots severely damaged
      in 1954 by Hurricane Hazel allowed comparison of recovery patterns and evaluation of long-term
      effects. I first assessed hurricane-induced structural and compositional changes and evaluated
      mortality risk factors. Fran caused widespread uprooting of large canopy trees. Stand-level
      damage severity varied substantially across the distributed network of permanent plots.
      Hurricane-induced mortality of large-size hardwoods was often delayed. Although tree damage
      was primarily caused by winds and rainfall, damage was also found to be correlated with site
      exposure, topographical position, tree size, and species susceptibility to wind. Next, to test
      the hypothesis that hurricanes maintain local tree diversity through increased heterogeneity
      and resource availability I examined changes in understory survivorship, recruitment, and
      growth. The understory experienced highly variable population impacts as well as subtle
      changes in tree diversity. Following Fran both seedlings and saplings exhibited an immediate
      drop in stem density followed by a rebound. In addition, the hurricane resulted in release of
      established, shade-intolerant or mid-tolerant seedlings and saplings, thereby potentially
      increasing future canopy tree diversity. Finally, I assessed whether hurricanes have long-term
      effects on tree diversity and succession. Past hurricanes appear to have accelerating
      succession in even-aged pine stands toward a later, hardwood-dominated successional stage, and
      to have shifted the hardwood forests toward more diverse composition, although with increasing
      dominance of red maple. I concluded that large, infrequent hurricanes play an important role
      in shaping forest structure and maintaining tree diversity in the Piedmont region. However,
      the effects on tree composition and diversity vary greatly and depend on local damage
      severity, pre-hurricane stand characteristics, and the temporal and spatial scales at which
      the changes are observed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>DNA microarrays allow researchers to measure the coexpression of thousands of genes,
      and are commonly used to identify changes in expression either across experimental conditions
      or in association with some clinical outcome. With increasing availability of gene annotation,
      researchers have begun to ask global questions of functional genomics that explore the
      interactions of genes in cellular processes and signaling pathways. A common hypothesis test
      for gene categories is constructed as a post hoc analysis performed once a list of significant
      genes is identified, using classically derived tests for 2x2 contingency tables. We note
      several drawbacks to this approach including the violation of an independence assumption by
      the correlation in expression that exists among genes. To test gene categories in a more
      appropriate manner, we propose a flexible, permutation-based framework, termed SAFE (for
      Significance Analysis of Function and Expression). SAFE is a two-stage approach, whereby
      gene-specific statistics are calculated for the association between expression and the
      response of interest and then a global statistic is used to detect a shift within a gene
      category to more extreme associations. Significance is assessed by repeatedly permuting whole
      arrays whereby the correlation between all genes is held constant and accounted for. This
      permutation scheme also preserves the relatedness of categories containing overlapping genes,
      such that error rate estimates can be readily obtained for multiple dependent tests. Through a
      detailed survey of gene category tests and simulations based on real microarray, we
      demonstrate how SAFE generates appropriate Type I error rates as compared to other methods.
      Under a more rigorously defined null hypothesis, permutation-based tests of gene categories
      are shown to be conservative by inducing a special case with a maximum variance for the test
      statistic. A bootstrap-based approach to hypothesis testing is incorporated into the SAFE
      framework providing better coverage and improved power under a defined class of alternatives.
      Lastly, we extend the SAFE framework to consider gene categories in a probabilistic manner.
      This allows for a hypothesis test of co-regulation, using models of transcription factor
      binding sites to score for the presence of motifs in the upstream regions of genes.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Overuse injuries are common clinical problems, athletically and occupationally, with
      estimates that nearly 50% of all injuries are overuse. Though a major clinical issue, the
      underlying etiology of tendon overuse injuries is unknown. Currently, the prevailing thought
      centers on microdamage accumulation. This is where loading (well below failure levels) causes
      damage at the fibrillar level. When this damage outpaces the tendon's ability to repair
      itself, then tendinopathy is thought to occur. The elastic limit beyond which this microdamage
      occurs has long been accepted at 4% strain. The first objective was to examine this idea
      utilizing newer methodologies by first loading tendons to various subfailiure strain levels,
      then loading to failure after rest. The elastic limit approached the failure strain limit
      (16%), implicating cellular responses as the driving factor in tendinopathy. To examine
      overuse tendinopathy, the next objective was to develop and characterize a model to apply and
      monitor complex, cyclic loadings to viable tendon. This device was able to significantly
      reduce the mechanical properties of loaded tendons (relative to control) as well as monitor
      this damage (strain accumulation). With a model established, cyclic loadings were performed
      across varying periods to assess cellular responses' role on tendon's mechanical and
      biochemical characteristics. Compositional changes, as well as pronounced magnitude and
      duration dependant effects in collagenase, cellularity and the inflammatory mediator PGE2 were
      observed. Significant loss of material properties were also observed with respect to loading
      magnitude. To determine the magnitude effect of these responses and separate it from duration
      dependence, an experiment with four levels of loading was performed across three days. This
      duration proved too short for compositional changes, however, significant magnitude dependant
      cellular responses were observed in regards to collagenase, cellularity and PGE2. PGE2, long
      hypothesized to contribute to tendinopathy development, was examined across cyclic loadings.
      PGE2 treatment caused decreased stiffness, resulting in increased strain and cellular
      responses. COX inhibitors were effective at reducing PGE2, as well as its responses. This
      study suggests PGE2 may contribute in driving healthy tendons into tendinopathy, however this
      response is reducible with COX inhibitors which otherwise showed no negative effects in an
      explant model.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Exposure to subacute levels of O3 causes decreased lung function, and airway
      hyperresponsiveness in 10-20% of the human population. Interindividual responses to O3 vary
      greatly, which suggests a genetic component. O3-induced inflammation results from activation
      of the innate immune response via specific receptors such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). TLR4
      activation leads to production of soluble mediators such as interleukins (IL)-12, IL-18, and
      IL-10 that can affect immune responses. However, the mechanism underlying TLR4-mediated
      responses as well as the contribution of variants in these specific innate immune response
      mediators have not been investigated in the inflammatory response to O3. We hypothesized that
      specific innate immune response mediators confer differential susceptibility to O3-induced
      inflammation in inbred mice. Studies with Tlr4-mutated (C3H/HeJ) and Tlr4-sufficient
      (C3H/HeOuJ) mice verified a role for TLR4 in O3-induced hyperpermeability and neutrophilic
      responses (Kleeberger et al., 2000) but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The
      accessory molecule CD14 is critical for TLR4-mediated responses to LPS. However, results from
      studies using Cd14 gene-deleted mice were negative and indicated that CD14 is not required for
      the response to O3. The downstream mediator IL-12 was found to contribute to O3-induced
      inflammation while IL-18 receptor was protective. Moreover, O3-induced neutrophilic
      inflammation was dramatically increased in mice lacking IL-10, an important anti-inflammatory
      cytokine, suggesting that IL-10 can potently attenuate neutrophilic influx in response to O3.
      Together these results suggest that the mechanism underlying O3-induced inflammation occurs
      independently of CD14 and that the cytokine milieu of the lung can alter the severity of
      inflammation in response to O3. The complex interplay of multiple genetic contributors must be
      considered to gain further insight into how inflammation is regulated in response to O3.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is critical for maintaining normal development,
      tissue homeostasis, and lymphocyte maturation. While this phenomenon is well documented, a
      limited number of receptors have been identified and mechanisms have only been partly
      elaborated. We hypothesized that the Axl/Mertk/Tyro3 family of receptor tyrosine kinases are
      involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells by immune cells. Here we demonstrate that in
      addition to Mertk, Axl and Tyro3 are required for efficient phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in
      macrophages and dendritic cells in vitro. Macrophages rely primarily on Mertk and less on Axl
      and Tyro3; whereas in contrast, dendritic cells rely on Axl and Tyro3 rather than Mertk for
      engulfment of dying cells. The difference between macrophage and dendritic cell phagocytosis
      can be partly explained by ligand and receptor expression levels. In vivo, Mertk is critical
      for clearance of apoptotic cells in the thymus and retina, whereas in the spleen Axl and Tyro3
      are most important for engulfment. Support for cooperation of the receptors in signaling can
      be found in data showing no detectable phosphorylation of Mertk in axl/tyro3-/- macrophages.
      This phosphorylation is thought to be important for downstream signaling of Vav1 and FAK to
      rearrange actin cytoskeleton or phagocytosis and migration. Indeed in the absence of tyro3 or
      axl/tyro3, there is lower association of Mertk with Vav1, and lower phosphorylation of FAK in
      the absence of tyro3. Although our data suggests an interaction between the three receptors in
      this family, no interaction was detectable in primary cells or transiently transfected cell
      lines. The phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is thought to down regulate proinflammatory
      cytokines; however, in the absence of Mertk, Axl, and/or Tyro3, no defect in the down
      regulation of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages was observed when compared with wild type.
      Therefore, we conclude that usage of Axl, Mertk, and Tyro3 is dependent on cell type and is
      critical for efficient phagocytosis both in vitro and in vivo, however the downstream
      signaling initiated by these receptors is limited to engulfment, and does not include the down
      regulation of inflammatory cytokines.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Problems involving multiphase flow and transport in porous media arise in a number of
      scientific and engineering applications including oil reservoir engineering and groundwater
      remediation. The inherent complexity of multiphase systems and the marked heterogeneity over
      multiple spatial scales result in significant challenges to the fundamental understanding of
      the multiphase flow and transport processes. For many decades, multiphase flow has been
      modeled using the traditional approach based on mass conservation and the generalized Darcy's
      law. The traditional approach, however, is subject to model errors and numerical errors. The
      focus of this dissertation research is to improve models of flow and transport in porous
      medium systems using numerical modeling approaches for a range of scales including pore scale
      and continuum scale. A major part of this research examines the deficiency of Darcy's
      relationship and its extension to multiphase flow using the lattice-Boltzmann (LB) approach.
      This study investigates the conventional relative permeability saturation relation for systems
      consisting of water and non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL). In addition, it also examines the
      generalized formulation accounting for the interfacial momentum transfer and lends additional
      support to the hypothesis that interfacial area is a critical variable in multiphase porous
      medium systems. Another major part of the research involves developing efficient and robust
      numerical techniques to improve the solution approach for existing models. In particular, a
      local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) spatial discretization method is developed in combination
      with a robust and established variable order, variable step-size temporal integration approach
      to solve Richards' equation (RE). Effective spatial adaptive LDG methods are also developed to
      further enhance the efficiency. The resulting simulator with both spatial and temporal
      adaption has demonstrated good performance for a series of problems modeled by RE.</mods:abstract>

      trafficking," and a variety of other terms. Rather than viewing receptors in a
      traditional way as digital entities (i.e., one or more active or inactive states), functional
      selectivity posits that a receptor can be induced into unique conformations that may lead to
      different patterns of activation of functional responses linked to a single receptor. This
      dissertation elucidates the molecular mechanisms that explain why some ligands can
      differentially activate the effector pathways coupled to the human D2L receptor. The focus
      will be to discern the structural interactions of the hD2L receptor with such functionally
      selective ligands, and how these interactions result in selective activation of effector
      pathways. Computationally-selected point mutations of the D2L receptor were made, and detailed
      analysis of both binding and function made for a series of rationally selected ligands,
      emphasizing compounds that were relatively rigid and had fewer degrees of freedom in possible
      docking poses. Functional assays tested the intrinsic activity and potency for GTP?S binding,
      inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP, phosphorylation of MAPK, and release of
      [3H]-arachidonic acid. Results from this dissertation provide evidence to support the
      hypothesis that ligand-selective interactions with specific residues of the receptor can
      induce conformational changes that lead to a characteristic pattern of activation of one of
      more signaling pathways. Developing a structure-based understanding of functional selectivity
      will provide general insight into the mechanisms of GPCR activation, and may also open the
      door to design of small molecules with desired patterns of functional effects at a single
      receptor.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>While pharmaceutical copayments are effective in containing system-level expenditures,
      the increased financial burden on patients may decrease medication compliance. Though many
      studies have focused on the effects of copayments on utilization, fewer have simultaneously
      examined copayments, compliance, and clinical outcomes, especially within heart failure
      patients. The rising prevalence and economic burden of heart disease underscores the need to
      research copayment effects on compliance and outcomes in this population. The primary
      objective of this research was to estimate the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitor, beta-adrenergic blocker and diuretic prescription copayment levels on medication
      compliance and hospitalizations in commercially insured heart failure patients. The secondary
      objective was to measure whether medication noncompliance mediates the association between
      copayment levels and hospitalizations. Heart failure patients were identified from the
      Integrated Health Care Information Solutions, Inc. database, containing a sample of United
      States commercially insured individuals between 1997 and 2005. Refill copayments were defined
      in categorical ranges, medication compliance by the Medication Possession Ratio, and
      hospitalizations by the presence of all-cause, cardiovascular specific or heart failure
      specific inpatient claims. This retrospective cohort study used ordinary least squares, random
      effects, and fixed effects regressions to estimate the effect of copayment level on compliance
      and logistic regressions to estimate the risk of hospitalizations conditional upon
      prescription copayment level. Mediation models were used to explore causal pathways between
      copayment level, medication compliance, and hospitalization. Beta blocker and diuretic refills
      with higher copayment levels were associated with up to a 9% and 21% decrease in medication
      compliance, respectively. In regards to clinical outcomes, higher diuretic copayments were
      associated with up to 1.4, 2.5, and 3.8 times the risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, or
      heart-failure specific hospitalization, respectively. Medication compliance did not mediate
      the association between copayment level and hospitalization. Results suggest that higher beta
      blocker and diuretic copayments are associated with decreased compliance in privately insured
      heart failure patients. Furthermore, higher diuretic copayments are associated with increased
      risk of hospitalization. Estimates need to be interpreted with caution given the absence of a
      control group. Future studies need to be conducted to determine the true causal nature of
      these associations</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>An isolated heart attached to a fluid-mechanical impedance (afterload) provides a
      method for study of myocardial processes and pressure and flow mechanics within the heart.
      Afterloads currently available allow various impedance parameter settings, but they are not
      automatically or dynamically controlled. A dynamically controlled afterload was constructed
      and its suitability tested for implementation with an isolated heart apparatus. Initial work
      was in development of a cardiovascular model to reveal trends for aortic pressure changes with
      afterload parameter adjustments. The LabVIEWTM model enables simulations with open-loop
      windkessel-type impedances and simulations with a closed-loop circulatory model. Cataloged
      trends were used to guide the dynamic afterload controls, and the open-loop impedances
      provided methods for modeling the fluid-mechanical system. Following this work, a systems
      analysis tool was developed in LabVIEWTM and Matlab to enable characterization of the
      fluid-mechanical afterload. The program contains time-domain and spectral analyses that
      incorporate equal variance algorithms for the correlation analyses and averaging methods for
      noise reduction in the spectral analyses for stationary signals. Auto- and cross-spectral
      analyses were used to generate system impedance spectra from dynamic afterload simulations.
      The culmination of this project was construction of a fluid-mechanical dynamic afterload. The
      dynamic nature of the afterload involves controlled, automatic adjustment of mechanical
      resistance, compliance and volume elements. These adjustments in afterload cause input
      pulsatile pressure to match the mean and range of a reference pressure. Simulations were
      performed with a pulsatile pressure pump for ten reference pressures with physiologically
      realistic mean and range values. The dynamic afterload constrained input pressures to within
      plus or minus 5% of the reference values and typically settled to the targeted values in 45 -
      50 cycles. Impedance spectra from the simulations provided consistent and physiologically
      realistic estimates of afterload parameters fitted to a four-element windkessel-type
      impedance. Effects of changing impedance on the mean, range and stroke volume followed
      anticipated trends. These tests demonstrate that the dynamic afterload exhibits the qualities
      necessary for implementation with an isolated heart apparatus. Furthermore, this system will
      enable studies both of transient behavior in the isolated heart with changing afterload and of
      controlled pressure characteristics from a changing input pressure source.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Cancer vaccines seek to harness the specificity of T and B lymphocytes for reduction
      of tumor burden, as well as prevention of recurrent disease by establishing immunological
      memory. Because of their ability to initiate adaptive immune responses, dendritic cells (DCs)
      presenting tumor antigens have frequently been used as cancer vaccines. Unfortunately,
      induction of therapeutic responses in cancer patients has been sporadic, suggesting that
      current DC vaccines are unable to surmount tolerance against tumor antigens. The transduction
      of DCs with recombinant viral vectors may be a viable strategy for augmenting the ability of
      DC vaccines to break tolerance, as this approach can be used to efficiently deliver tumor
      antigens to DCs in the context of an immunostimulatory viral infection. Therefore, we have
      investigated the potential of DCs transduced with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus
      replicon particles (VRPs) as cancer vaccines. VRPs could efficiently transduce human and
      murine immature DCs ex vivo, leading to high-level transgene expression, DC maturation,
      secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and efficient presentation of VRP-encoded antigens to T
      cells. VRP-transduced DCs (VRP-DCs) expressing a truncated neu oncoprotein stimulated
      neu-specific T cell and antibody responses and induced regression of established tumors in
      nontolerant mice. In contrast, VRP-DCs failed to induce robust antitumor responses in mice
      tolerant to neu, and were likewise unable to inhibit tumor growth. Depletion of CD4+CD25+
      regulatory T cells (Treg) improved the effectiveness of VRP-DC vaccines in tolerant mice,
      demonstrating that VRP-DCs alone were unable to overcome Treg activity. Furthermore, provision
      of tolerant mice with neu-specific T cells from nontolerant mice did not augment vaccine
      efficacy, indicating that tolerogenic mechanisms are dominant over effector T cell activity.
      These results demonstrate that while highly immunogenic, virally-activated DCs cannot break
      tolerance against self/tumor antigens. Moreover, these findings imply that potent DC vaccines
      alone are unlikely to induce therapeutic antitumor immunity unless additional measures are
      undertaken to inhibit immunoregulatory mechanisms.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a very challenging disease clinically because of
      lacking effective treatments. Accurate and accessible preclinical models of GBM are required
      to both understand these diseases and facilitate development of diagnostic tests and
      therapies. Recently, genetic mutations in human gliomas are better understood and techniques
      to generate genetically engineered mice (GEM) are more sophisticated, which makes it possible
      to mimic those mutations in the mouse in an accurate way. Here, we developed mouse models of
      human GBM by simulating most common genetic mutations in human GBMs, including abnormal
      RTK-Ras signal, Rb pathway, and Pten locus. In the beginning, the model was manipulated so
      that the mutation (K-RasG12D) was transferred to astrocytes using an hGFAP-Cre allele, which
      resulted in primary GBMs. This model is valuable for understanding the role of K-Ras
      overactivation in primary GBM's formation and cell-oforigin. However, developmental phenotypes
      other than GBM in this model restrict its further uses in mechanistic studies and combinations
      with other mutations. In subsequent models, we modified the strategy and generated an
      inducible system, in which genetic changes can be spatially and temporally induced in adult
      astrocytes, thus avoiding developmental defects. Induction is elicited by activation of
      CreERtam, expressed from the human GFAP promoter, after intraperitoneal 4OH-tamoxifen
      injection. With high penetrance and reproducible timing, the combination of all three events
      induces tumors that possess all common histological features of human GBM, including brain
      invasion, high mitotic indexes, angiogenesis, and necrosis. Furthermore, analysis of event
      combinations provides insight into disease etiology. For example, without Pten inactivation,
      pRb inactivation and K-Ras activation predispose to high-grade astrocytic tumors that lack the
      necrotic phenotype characteristic of GBM. Neither activation of K-Ras nor inactivation of Pten
      alone produces detectable pathology, and thus are involved in tumor progression. In contrast,
      inactivation of pRb function initiates disease that does not progress to high-grade tumors.
      Because of their inducibility, high-penetrance and molecular and histological similarity to
      human high-grade astrocytomas, these models are extremely promising for both further
      mechanistic analyses and for preclinical studies, including the validation of potential drug
      targets and diagnostic and therapeutic development.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation examines illness self-management among adults living with
      ANCA-associated small vessel vasculitis (ANCA-SVV). Manuscript #1 describes the development
      and evaluation of the Vasculitis Self-Management Scale (VSMS), a self-report measure of
      self-management among adults with ANCA-SVV. Manuscript #2 characterizes patients' attitudes
      and beliefs, including perceived barriers and facilitators, about ANCA-SVV self-management,
      and examines their relationship to self-management. Manuscript #3 explores spousal
      accommodative behavior as a supportive process that facilitates self-management. Specifically,
      it tests whether patients' perceptions of general and/or illness-specific spouse support
      mediate the relationship between spousal accommodative behavior and patients' self-management.
      The VSMS was administered via mail questionnaire, along with measures of socio-demographics,
      clinical factors, psychosocial factors, and self-management attitudes and beliefs. The sample
      for manuscripts #1 and #2 consisted of 205 patients, while the sample for manuscripts #3
      included 159 married patients. The final VSMS assessed eight domains: medication adherence,
      health services adherence, infection avoidance adherence, diet adherence, exercise adherence,
      symptom monitoring adherence, appropriate adjusting of activities in response to fatigue or
      symptoms, and prompt reporting of new symptoms or side effects to a health professional.
      Analyses demonstrated good evidence of internal consistency and test-retest reliability, and
      mixed evidence of construct validity. With few exceptions, patients' perceived difficulty and
      number of perceived barriers were negatively associated with self-management, while greater
      perceived importance predicted higher levels of self-management. Some specific barriers, but
      not facilitators, were negatively associated with self-management. Spousal constructive
      accommodation was positively associated with general, but not illness-specific, support.
      General support was positively associated with medication adherence, health services
      adherence, and appropriate adjusting of activities in response to fatigue and symptoms. Spouse
      retaliation was negatively associated with illness-specific, but not general, support.
      Illness-specific support was positively associated with medication adherence, infection
      avoidance adherence, and appropriate adjusting of activities in response to fatigue and
      symptoms. Formal tests of the indirect effects of spousal accommodative behavior on
      self-management via spouse support approached but did not reach statistical significance.
      Findings suggest that the VSMS is a promising method for assessing illness self-management in
      adults living with ANCA-SVV. Potential avenues for future intervention efforts with this
      population are considered.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Heparan sulfate (HS) is a structurally diverse and highly sulfated polysaccharide that
      has been found to exist on the surface of mammalian cells in substantial quantities. Unique
      saccharide sequences of HS have been shown to bind specifically to a number of biologically
      relevant proteins, thus allowing HS to play a role in numerous biological processes including
      regulation of blood coagulation, inflammation, cancer cell growth and viral infections.
      Understanding the structure-function relationship of HS will aid in the development of novel
      anti-viral and/or anti-cancer therapeutics. Previous studies have shown that
      3-Osulfotransferase isoform 3 (3-OST-3) generates 3-O-sulfated HS that can bind to
      glycoprotein D (gD) and facilitate HSV viral entry into target cells, thus implicating
      3-Osulfated HS as a HSV entry receptor. The goal of this work is to provide additional
      structural information concerning HS ability to assist in the HSV viral infection mechanism,
      while providing evidence to suggest that HSV infections may be inhibited by disrupting the
      interactions with its polysaccharide based cellular receptors. The use of 3-O-sulfated heparin
      (HP) oligosaccharides, along with high expression levels of gD purified from E. coli., allowed
      for the investigation of the gD binding of various sized HP oligosaccharides. Results obtained
      from immunoprecipitation and affinity co-electrophoresis experiments suggested that the
      3-O-sulfated HP octasaccharide was of the minimal required length for gD binding with a Kd
      value of 19 mu-M. Structural characterization using chemical and enzymatic approaches
      suggested the gD binding 3-O-sulfated HP octasaccharide had a structure of
      Delta-UA2S-GlcNS6S-IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S-IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S3S-IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S (3-Osulfation site is
      underlined). Coupling a sulfo donor regeneration system with 3-OST-3 modification, sufficient
      amounts of the gD binding 3-O-sulfated HP octasaccharide was generated for cell based viral
      entry assays. The characterization of a novel gD binding octasaccharide as described herein,
      provides additional structural information concerning HS/HP ability to assist in the HSV viral
      entry mechanism. Specifically, it allows for further investigations to be conducted as the
      characterized 3-O-sulfated gD binding HP octasaccharide may serve as a good lead compound for
      the inhibition of HSV infections. The further development of this project could uncover a new
      way to treat diseases related to HSV infections.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Non-inferiority clinical trials are increasingly becoming more prominent in research
      and development of new pharamaceuticals. The objective of such trials is to show that the
      amount by which a new treatment is worse than an active control is below a specified amount.
      Methodology specifically for the design and analysis of these trials is essential for the
      assurance of quality trials that are statistically defensible in the scientific community as
      well as in a regulatory setting, where traditionally focus has been on superiority. Standard
      methodology must be reviewed and assessed as to its appropriateness for addressing the
      non-inferiority hypothesis. Categorical data analysis for a dichotomous primary endpoint may
      include analysis of a risk ratio or a risk difference which compares the test and active
      control treatments. The effect of sample size allocation and other parameters of interest on
      the performance of these methods will be assessed. In addition, appropriate sample size
      formulas will be developed and evaluated to aid in trial planning. In some non-inferiority
      trials, it is possible to include a placebo arm as well as an active control arm which allows
      non-inferiority to be assessed relative to the percentage of the difference between the
      control and placebo arms that the test treatment preserves over placebo. Methodology for this
      assessment is also of interest along with appropriate sample size calculations. This setting
      also presents an area of research for discussion of the one versus two trials paradigm.
      Extensions to the methodology for the risk ratio and risk difference are assessed when
      stratification is necessary, specifically for large subgroups such as gender. Methods for
      stratification are an important component, and additionally the effects of stratification in a
      non-inferiority setting need evaluation. Review, development, and assessment of this
      methodology for categorical data as specifically focused on the non-inferiority setting is an
      important addition to the current statistical practice. This research is a cohesive
      presentation for each of the measures of interest through assessment of methodology and its
      relation to appropriate design components such as sample size calculation. The importance of
      helping statisticians understand and implement methods in these areas is of most concern.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Telomeres are typically long nucleoprotein structures that protect the ends of linear
      chromosomes from exonucleolytic attack and from being recognized as DNA double strand breaks.
      Telomeric DNA is lost either gradually, as a consequence of cellular ageing, or sometimes
      rapidly, when the telomere structure is disrupted or due to errors in telomere maintenance.
      When greatly shortened, telomeres will signal a DNA damage message that results in an active
      growth arrest and eventually, cell death. Telomeres are thus molecular clocks that present a
      formidable barrier against cancer, because functional telomeres are essential for continued
      cell proliferation. Thus an important strategy for cancer therapeutics lies in understanding
      and targeting telomere-lengthening mechanisms used by cancer cells. However, telomere length
      is determined by the intricate interplay of the components that lengthen telomeres and those
      that shorten them. Therefore, a detailed understanding is also needed of the structures and
      functions of telomere factors present in normal cells, and of how changes in these can lead to
      cancer. Presented here are structural analyses of the telomeric DNA itself; the yeast RNA
      component of the telomere-lengthening protein, telomerase; and the DNA binding properties of
      telomerase and another telomere-specific protein, TRF2. Together, the data adds to a more
      comprehensive structural model for the manner in which telomeres function in vivo.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>There have been many experiments on breast cancer cell lines and tumors with respect
      to identifying genes/pathways that are involved in cancer initiation, progression and response
      to therapy; however, only a few actually make suggestions that might affect treatment. The
      knowledge that breast cancer actually represents several diseases that arise from at least two
      different epithelial cells has been a major stepping-stone for stratifying patients and
      identifying more selective and biology-based therapies. Drugs aimed at the estrogen receptor,
      estrogen production, and HER2 have been very successful in the many patients whose tumors are
      dependent upon these signaling pathways for growth. Unfortunately for tumors that lack these
      markers, such as basal-like subtype, there are few treatment options. Until recently, few
      studies had actually considered if there were subtype-specific differences in response to
      chemotherapy. This dissertation focuses on the basal-like subtype of cancer and examines
      responses to chemotherapeutics relative to the luminal subtypes and evaluates the EGFR pathway
      as a place for potential therapeutic intervention. In response to two chemotherapeutics -
      doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil - a general stress response was the dominant profile and this
      profile varied both in vitro and in vivo between the subtypes. The drug-specific response was
      more similar in the subtypes. A predictive gene list was identified that could predict both
      subtype and drug treatment with fairly high accuracy suggesting some degree of
      subtype-specific mechanism of action. The different responses to doxorubicin and
      5-fluorouracil led us to evaluate sensitivity to a larger panel of drugs and cell lines and we
      determined that the basal-like subtype was more sensitive to carboplatin. While identification
      of chemotherapy regimens that are beneficial to the basal-like subtype is needed, drugs
      targeted to specific deregulated pathways in this subtype will be more effective in the long
      run. My work evaluated the EGFR pathway and determined it is high in 90% of all basal-like
      tumors, but I also identified high expression of genes downstream of EGFR that can induce
      EGFR-independent activation of this pathway. My data suggest that inhibition of MEK or PI3K,
      along with chemotherapeutics, may be an effective regimen for basal-like patients. </mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation employed multilevel growth curve models to examine the development
      of physical and social aggression during adolescence and assessed neighborhood- and
      family-level predictors of the developmental trajectories. The first study showed that
      perpetration of physical and social aggression followed curvilinear trajectories between ages
      11 and 18, with increases in each type of aggression followed by declines. Girls had
      significantly lower initial levels of physical aggression than boys. Sex did not impact rates
      of change of physical aggression, and boys consistently perpetrated more physical aggression
      than girls did. There were no sex differences in the initial levels or rates of change of
      social aggression. The second study found that the effects of neighborhood socioeconomic
      disadvantage and social disorganization on aggression trajectories were best described by
      direct effects models, rather than the hypothesized moderation models. For girls, neighborhood
      socioeconomic disadvantage was positively associated with initial levels of physical
      aggression. There were no significant main effects of the neighborhood variables on social
      aggression for girls, and for boys, there were no significant main effects of the neighborhood
      variables for either type of aggression. There was evidence suggesting confounding of the
      effects of disadvantage and disorganization when predicting physical aggression. The third
      study revealed that family factors did not moderate the relationship between neighborhood risk
      and the aggression trajectories as hypothesized. For boys, more family conflict and less
      parental control were associated with higher initial levels of physical aggression, and more
      family conflict, less parent-child bonding and less parental control were associated with
      higher initial levels of social aggression. For girls, more neighborhood socioeconomic
      disadvantage, more family conflict, less parent-child bonding and less parental control were
      associated with higher initial levels of physical aggression, and more family conflict and
      less parent-child bonding were associated with higher initial levels of social aggression.
      Family conflict also influenced the linear slopes of the girls' physical aggression
      trajectories and the linear slopes of the social aggression trajectories for both boys and
      girls. All significant predictors impacted initial levels of aggression, which suggests that
      early prevention programs are needed to reduce perpetration of aggression during adolescence.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Community groups in North Carolina are concerned that solid waste facilities may be
      disproportionately located in non-white and low-wealth communities, that this represents an
      environmental injustice, and that solid waste facilities negatively impact the health of host
      communities. However, the relationship between environmental injustice and health has not been
      fully evaluated. A conceptual model was developed as a basis for exploring the relationships
      between environmental injustice, solid waste, and health. While this model includes health
      impacts associated with direct exposures to toxicants, the emphasis is on the indirect effects
      of solid waste facilities on health through their impacts on the built environment. This model
      was used to inform analyses that evaluated the prevalence and occurrence of solid waste
      facilities in non-white communities compared to white communities and low-wealth communities
      compared to high-wealth communities in North Carolina. Communities were defined as census
      block groups in order to obtain information on racial and economic characteristics.
      Information on solid waste facilities was obtained through a review of solid waste facility
      records maintained by the North Carolina Division of Waste Management. The results of these
      analyses suggest that on average in North Carolina, the prevalence of solid waste facilities
      in 2003 was greater in non-white communities (50 to 100% non-white) compared to white
      communities (&lt;10% non-white) (adjusted prevalence odds ratio [adjPOR]: 2.8; 95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.9, 4.1); and low-wealth communities (median house values
      &lt;{dollar}60,000) compared to high-wealth communities (median house values less than or
      equal to {dollar}100,000) (adjPOR: 1.5; 95% CI: 0.9, 2.5). Among block groups that did not
      contain a previously permitted solid waste facility, the occurrence of solid waste facilities

      (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.7). Solid waste facilities present numerous public
      health concerns including potential for water contamination, traffic safety, malodors, and
      impacts on health promoting resources. As proposals to site additional solid waste facilities
      in North Carolina are discussed, these results should be considered to minimize the

               <mods:abstract>Federal family planning clinics provide adolescents a safe place to receive
      contraception and maintain reproductive health without parental consent or prohibitive
      expense. The purpose of this study was to explore knowledge and opinions of family planning
      providers regarding counseling minors on sexually sensitive matters. Topics examined included
      providers': knowledge of state's statutory rape laws and federal Title X regulations;
      perceptions regarding counseling on sexually sensitive matters; and opinions on the possible
      conflict between mandatory statutory rape reporting and federal regulations regarding
      protection of confidentiality. This cross-sectional study surveyed all North Carolina health
      department family planning providers. Quantitative methods were used to examine knowledge
      levels and counseling comfort levels among providers. Qualitative analysis methods were used
      to examine the potential conflict between mandatory reporting and protection of
      confidentiality. Completion rate was 64% (n=397). Providers had higher knowledge of federal
      Title X regulations ( x =3.51 out of 4) than state statutory rape laws ( x =1.94 out of 4).
      Analysis of statutory rape knowledge and provider characteristics showed that only attending a
      larger number of training workshops was statistically significant; no statistically
      significant differences were seen among other provider characteristics and Title X knowledge.
      Providers had high levels of comfort concerning general and sexual health counseling, with
      mean scores of 3.44 and 3.35, respectively out of 4. Comfort dropped considerably when
      counseling a client who discloses sexual abuse ( x =2.86) or statutory rape ( x =2.69). Nurse
      practitioners and those with more continuing education had significantly higher comfort levels
      counseling on sexual abuse and statutory rape. Participants were evenly split regarding
      whether reporting hampered confidentiality; those agreeing felt it could limit clinic use and
      increase negative health consequences; those who disagreed felt it was important to advocate
      for their clients. This study is the first to delve into providers' opinions on their ability
      to meet the reproductive health needs of their adolescent clients given state laws and
      regulations. Increased training on sexual violence is desired by providers. Policies should be
      structured to ensure providers can protect the current and future health of adolescent
      clients.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Meiotic recombination gives rise to crossovers, which are required in most organisms
      for the faithful segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiotic cell division.
      Investigation of the details of this process has centered largely on studies in fungi;
      however, recent evidence suggests that a complete understanding will require this question to
      be approached in multiple model organisms. In this thesis, I report the development of tools
      for expanding the study of meiotic recombination in Drosophila melanogaster. I have combined
      an existing assay for the selection of rare recombination events with molecular techniques to
      allow the fine dissection of the structures of recombination events. I demonstrate the utility
      of this assay by using it to investigate recombination in a known meiotic mutant, mei-9. The
      results of this investigation provide evidence supporting a role for MEI-9 in resolving
      recombination intermediates to generate crossovers, and supporting a model in which
      noncrossovers are generated by multiple pathways. I also report the genetic characterization
      of the role of a partner protein of MEI-9, ERCC1. These results suggest that the functional
      protein complex for the generation of meiotic crossovers contains MEI-9, ERCC1, and a
      previouslycharacterized protein, MUS312. Additionally, I created a Drosophila mismatch repair
      mutant, Msh6, and used my newly-developed assay to investigate meiotic recombination events in
      this mutant. This constitutes the first investigation of meiotic mismatch repair in
      Drosophila. Results of this assay show that elimination of mismatch repair allows the recovery
      of unrepaired heteroduplex DNA with high efficiency. Characterization of the structure and
      arrangement of heteroduplex DNA is instrumental in the dissection of molecular models of
      meiotic recombination. The creation of a mutant in which heteroduplex DNA can be recovered in
      Drosophila does much to put the molecular characterization of meiotic recombination in this
      organism on a par with studies in fungi. Using this assay, I also show strong evidence for a
      "short-patch" repair pathway that acts in the absence of canonical mismatch
      repair in Drosophila. In this thesis, I demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of using
      Drosophila to further our understanding of the crucial process of meiotic recombination, and
      report the development of a number of tools that demonstrate the attractiveness of using this
      model organism for these studies.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study explores the emergence of supply chain mandates, initiatives by which
      businesses demand changes in the social or environmental behavior of suppliers and business
      partners over whom they exert economic influence. Under these mandates, firms within a
      corporation's production network are contractually obliged to adopt verifiable codes of
      conduct or certification institutions using the promise of future business, or threats of no
      future contracts, as incentives. It examines how major first-tier auto suppliers have
      themselves received and implemented mandates from the auto manufacturers to adopt formal
      environmental management systems (EMS), and how Mexican automotive suppliers in turn have
      responded to these mandates. Finally, it identifies other factors that influence the adoption
      of more systematic environmental management practices. Evidence for the study was collected
      through interviews with automotive manufacturers and large multinational suppliers and through
      a survey of Mexican automotive suppliers, and the resulting data were analyzed using several
      regression techniques including ordinal logistic regression and twostage treatment effects
      models. The analyses find a large discrepancy between those facilities subject to supply chain
      mandates from major customers and those who actually adopt EMSs. However, several factors
      including the perceived importance of mandates, technical considerations related to more
      general industrial upgrading strategies, and ownership by US firms affect the adoption of EMSs
      by suppliers operating in Mexico. It also finds that while supply chain mandates may have a
      negligible affect on the emphasis facilities place on specific environmental objectives,
      including regulatory compliance, pollution prevention, and eco-efficiency, having an EMS in
      place does influence prioritization of these objectives. Therefore, in cases where supply
      chain mandates effectively lead to EMS adoption, deeper commitments can be expected. The study
      also discusses the institutional failures related to monitoring and enforcement that hinder
      diffusion throughout the value chain and the potential for these quasi-regulatory private
      mechanisms to provide public benefits, particularly in industrializing nations.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Understanding cellular and molecular components of cell migration is critical to the
      advancement of normal physiology and cancer biology. There is growing realization that
      finger-like cellular protrusions called filopodia play central roles in the cell biology
      underlying angiogenesis and inflammation (Anderson and Anderson, 1976; Gerhardt et al., 2003).
      Despite this knowledge, very little is known about the fundamental mechanisms governing
      filopodia formation, signaling, and adhesion. Unconventional myosins, particularly the
      MyTH4-FERM class of myosins, are implicated in precisely these types of filopodial functions
      (Tuxworth et al., 2001). Myosin-X (Myo10) is a vertebrate-specific member of the MyTH4-FERM
      class of myosins that is expressed in most cells and tissues. When expressed in cells,
      GFP-Myo10 displays a striking localization to tips of filopodia and undergoes intrafilopodial
      motility (Berg and Cheney, 2002). The experiments described in this dissertation demonstrate
      that Myo10 is a component of a putative filopodial tip complex, that it binds integrins (Zhang
      et al., 2004), and that it is a potent inducer of dorsal filopodia (Bohil et al., 2006).</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Heparan sulfate (HS), a universally expressed and abundant macromolecule found at the
      cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, plays fundamental roles in a wide variety of
      physiological and pathophysiological processes, and it represents a promising therapeutic
      agent for current and future pharmaceutical research. The diverse functions of HS rely on its
      diverse structures, resulting from modifications by many HS biosynthetic enzymes.
      Understanding HS fine structure regulation by these enzymes is fundamental to therapeutic
      intervention targeting numerous HS involved diseases. Towards this end, characterization of
      all HS modification enzymes and their structure-function relationships is essential. In this
      research, the substrate specificity of 3OST6, a novel HS 3-O-sulfotransferase, was
      characterized using a CHO cell line stably expressing 3OST6. The HS structure generated by
      3OST6 was also determined to be capable of serving as an HSV-1 entry receptor. Next,
      facilitated by a novel recombinant protein expression system developed in the lab, HS 3OST5
      was purified and its crystal structure was solved in complex with 3?- phosphoadenosine
      5?-phosphate; while HS 2OST was purified and is currently under crystallization trials.
      Moreover, a systematic mutational study of HS 2OST and chondroitin sulfate (CS) 2OST, an
      enzyme homologous to HS 2OST modifying CS chain, was conducted based on homology models
      derived from structure-solved sulfotransferases. From this study, a co-factor binding site and
      a potential substrate binding site were identified. More importantly, a unique catalytic site
      of HS 2OST was proposed, which is not present in CS 2OST even though these two enzymes
      catalyze the same chemical reaction. This study provided the first structure-function
      relationship data for these two enzymes. Furthermore, it prompted us to identify the authentic
      enzyme possessing the function of HS 2OST in Drosophila, which was mistakenly assigned to
      another homologous protein.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>We live in a dynamic environment with atmospheric pollutants constantly transforming,
      interacting with one another, and generating secondary pollutants. Many of these secondary
      pollutants have not been identified and, because they are often more oxygenated, many are more
      toxic than their parent compounds. Continuous emissions from biogenic and anthropogenic
      sources into this reactive environment create problematic conditions for evaluating the
      respiratory toxicity of exposure to individual components of urban atmospheres. While previous
      investigations have studied individual atmospheric components of air pollution, the evaluation
      of "one atmosphere" effects has been limited by experimental complexities.
      In this work, new techniques were developed to create an air-liquid interface exposure system
      coupled with a controllable atmospheric reactor, or "smog chamber", and
      these were used to examine various reactive atmospheric mixtures using a laboratory setting
      that still mimicked the outdoor environment. This smog chamber - in vitro exposure system
      combines common techniques used in classic toxicology with an outdoor environmental chamber
      system that was developed to investigate chemical reaction mechanisms. This dissertation is
      divided into three main parts that demonstrate new methods to study reactive atmospheric
      pollutants utilizing the smog chamber - in vitro exposure system. In the first part,
      1,3-butadiene and isoprene were used to evaluate the differences in respiratory toxicity
      between unreacted parent pollutants and their complete mixture of products generated during
      photochemical transformations. The second part applied similar techniques to differentiate the
      roles that specific photochemical products play in the induction of toxicity mediators; in
      particular, the role of ozone effects compared to the other known, first generation products.
      In addition to determining the effects induced by product mixtures generated during
      photochemical transformations, understanding which products induce the greatest overall effect
      is particularly helpful when regulating ambient pollutants. In the final part, a
      preconditioning method was developed to ascertain if repeated ozone exposures modify the
      respiratory effects induced by subsequent challenges to atmospheric mixtures. Combined, these
      results characterize and estimate the toxic potential of a realistic, complex, reacting,
      polluted atmosphere.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation investigates the effect of obesity on labor market outcomes. Obesity
      is important for labor market outcomes. Obese people may be discriminated against by consumers
      or employers due to their distaste for obese people. Employers also may not want to hire obese
      people due to the expected health cost if the employers provide health insurance to their
      employees. Because of those consumers' and employers' distaste for obese people or because of
      these different costs, being obese may result in poor labor market outcomes in terms of wages
      and/or the likelihood of being employed, as well as sorting of obese people into jobs where
      slimness is not rewarded. This study used the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979
      (NLSY79). The NLSY79 provides panel information for a nationally representative sample of
      12,686 young men and women who were 14 to 22 years old when first surveyed in 1979. The sample
      was followed for 14 years. Labor market outcomes were measured by 1) the probability of
      employment, and 2) the probability of holding occupations where slimness potentially rewards
      hourly wages. Weight was measured by Body Mass Index (BMI). All results were assessed
      separately by gender as a function of BMI splines and other controls. The endogeneity of BMI
      was controlled in a two-stage instrumental variable estimation model with over-identifying
      exogenous individual and state-level instruments, controlling for individual fixed effects.
      The Heckman selection model was used to control for the selection into the labor force, with
      the state-level identifying instruments of the non-employment rate, the number of business
      establishments, and the number of Social Security Program beneficiaries. Results show that
      gaining weight adversely affects labor market outcomes for women, but the effect is mixed for
      men overall. The size and direction of the effects vary by gender, age groups, and type of
      occupations. Findings from this investigation could help our understanding of the economic
      cost of obesity to an individual beside its adverse effect on health. The spillover effect of
      obesity will increase the total cost of obesity to both individuals and society as a whole.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Signal transduction is the fundamental biological process of converting changes in
      extracellular information into changes in intracellular functions. It controls a wide range of
      cellular activities, from the release of neurotransmitters and hormones, to integrated
      cellular decisions of proliferation, differentiation, survival, or death. The vast majority of
      extracellular signaling molecules exert their cellular effects through activation of G
      protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs); however, the G-protein coupled paradigm is by no means the
      exclusive mechanism of membrane receptor signal transduction. Polypeptide ligands such as
      nerve growth factor act exclusively on receptor tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) to promote
      signaling. GPCRs and RTKs both form an interface between extracellular and intracellular
      physiology by converting hormonal signals into changes in intracellular metabolism and
      ultimately cell phenotype. Initially, it was thought that GPCRs and RTKs represented linear
      and distinct signaling pathways that converge on downstream targets to regulate cell division
      and gene transcription. However, activation of second messenger generating systems do not
      fully explain the range of effects of GPCR or RTK activation on biological processes such as
      differentiation and cell growth. Recent work has revealed that GPCR and RTK signaling pathways
      are not mutually exclusive of one another; in fact, they often function as partners, forming
      complex signaling networks through scaffold/nexus proteins. The work described herein examines
      the complexity of signal regulation by multifunctional nexus proteins. I showed that the
      activation of phospholipase C-? by G?12/13-coupled receptors occurs through a mechanism
      involving the small GTPase Rho. I demonstrated the usefulness and complexities of 'regulators
      of G-protein signaling' (RGS proteins) for discerning the G? selectivity of GPCR signaling.
      Finally, I found that RGS12, in addition to regulating G? signaling, acts as a Ras/Raf/MEK
      scaffold in nerve growth factor-mediated differentiation. The work presented here expands our
      understanding of how multiple domain proteins facilitate convergence and cross-regulation of
      RTK, heterotrimeric G-protein, and Ras-superfamily signaling.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this dissertation, I investigated the effect of timing and frequency of Plasmodium
      falciparum infection during pregnancy on the risk of low birth weight and maternal anemia. I
      also investigated the efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combined with azithromycin or
      artesunate compared with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine monotherapy as treatment for uncomplicated
      Plasmodium falciparum infection in pregnant women. We conducted a prospective observational
      study recruiting 2,462 pregnant women in Malawi. Malaria was assessed during follow-up and
      delivery. Birth weight and hemoglobin concentration were measured at delivery. The prevalence
      of low birth weight increased with the number of malaria episodes: [1 episode (prevalence
      ratio [PR] =2.17; 95% C.I. 1.22-3.86), and 2 episodes (PR=3.68; 95% C.I. 1.81-7.47)]. The
      prevalence of anemia increased with the number of episodes of malaria: [1 episode (PR= 1.16;
      95% C.I. 0.77-1.77) and 2 episodes (PR= 1.82 95% C.I. 1.04-3.19)]. The prevalence of low birth
      weight was higher with infection in the second trimester (PR=2.97; 95% CI 1.60-5.53) than in
      the third trimester (PR=1.42; 95% CI 0.63-3.22). The prevalence of maternal anemia was higher
      with infection in the third trimester (PR=1.44; 95% CI 0.90-2.29) than in the second trimester
      (PR=0.94; 95% CI 0.51-1.71). Timing and frequency of infection affect the risk of maternal
      anemia and low birth weight. We conducted a randomized open-label clinical trial, recruiting
      141 pregnant women. They were randomly allocated to 3 treatment groups:
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP; 3 tablets, 500mg sulfadoxine and 25mg pyrimethamine per
      tablet); SP plus azithromycin (1g/day x 2 days); or SP plus artesunate (400mg/day x 3 days).
      All treatment regimens were well tolerated. Two women vomited soon after ingesting
      azithromycin. Recrudescent episodes of malaria were less frequent with SP-azithromycin [Hazard
      Ratio 0.14 (95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.78)] and SP-artesunate [Hazard Ratio 0.13 (95%
      confidence interval 0.03 to 0.53)] compared with SP monotherapy. There were more abortions in
      the SP-azithromycin group, and more stillbirths in the SP-artesunate groups, but they were
      probably unrelated to treatment. A larger study is needed to determine its safety and efficacy
      in preventing poor birth outcomes.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This project was pursued to evaluate the applicability of in vivo brain extracellular
      fluid concentrations, obtained via brain-homogenate equilibrium dialysis, to assess extent of
      CNS penetration and provide estimates of CNS biophase concentrations. Parallel experimentation
      was conducted to define the impact of blood-brain barrier (BBB) efflux on opioid
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), and to evaluate mathematical approaches for
      assessing efflux transport kinetics. Steady-state unbound plasma-to-unbound brain
      concentration ratios and in vivo P-gp efflux ratios were determined in mice and used to
      evaluate extent of CNS distribution for 34 drugs. PK/PD studies were conducted with seven
      opioids to estimate ED50, serum EC50, and brain EC50; relevant in vitro and clinical
      parameters were used to construct in vitro-to-preclinical and preclinical-to-clinical
      comparisons of opioid potency. PK/PD studies were conducted in P-gp-deficient mice to assess
      the influence of BBB efflux transport on CNS PK/PD for opioid substrates of P-gp.
      Comprehensive mathematical modeling was employed to evaluate the influence of efflux, or
      efflux inhibition, on brain exposure, and to evaluate several potential metrics of efflux. The
      unbound plasma-to-unbound brain concentration ratio proved to be a valuable parameter for
      assessing the CNS distribution of drugs (equivalent to or superior to the in vivo P-gp efflux
      ratio). Opioid PK/PD studies indicated that, for centrally-active agents, unbound brain EC50,u
      was the best descriptor of in vivo intrinsic potency, resulting in a in vitro-to-in vivo
      correlation of r2~0.8. P-gp-mediated efflux attenuated central activity of fentanyl,
      methadone, and loperamide by decreasing brain-to-plasma ratios, but did not influence brain
      EC50. BBB efflux also decreased fentanyl, methadone, and loperamide brain:plasma equilibration
      half-life by ~2-fold, consistent with mathematical predictions. Mathematical modeling revealed
      that 50% inhibition of BBB efflux results in brain exposure increasing less than or equal to
      2-fold; conventional mathematical treatment of efflux inhibition data overestimates Km and
      IC50. New mathematical relationships for expressing efflux activity and calculating Km and
      IC50 developed in this project overcomes limitations of conventional mathematical treatment.
      Knowledge of unbound brain concentrations and the influence of BBB efflux transport is
      important in developing a comprehensive understanding of CNS PK/PD for individual compounds or
      for members of a compound set.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Malnutrition is a widespread concern in developing countries, impacting children's
      cognitive and physical development, quality of life and lifetime productivity. Interventions
      to improve nutritional status in international contexts require identification of at-risk
      populations and correct conclusions about general nutritional needs. Screening tools are
      currently being developed to meet these needs. Dietary diversity indicators are promising
      tools currently being studied. They are typically counts of food groups in the diet (i.e. a
      sum of defined food groups consumed in a defined time period) and are practical for field use
      because they are simply measured and positively correlated with nutrient intakes. We created
      age-specific diversity scores (based on a pre-existing tool) for use in both early childhood
      and adolescence, and evaluated their relationship to nutritional adequacy, nutritional status
      (measured by height for age Z-score), and their combined ability to predict adult height. Data
      were taken from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, a Filipino birth cohort of
      3,080 followed from the early 1980s through the present. We found that using minimum portion
      requirements improved the relationship of scores to nutrient adequacy for the 6 nutrients
      evaluated (vitamin A, iron, calcium, niacin, riboflavin, iron). Modified scores also reflected
      amounts of food consumed, i.e. children with increasing dietary diversity also ate larger
      amounts of individual food groups. Related increases in nutrient adequacy were largely due to
      these increased energy intakes, but there were also small increases in the nutrient density of
      the diet at both ages. Linear models were used to evaluate the relationship of both scores to
      height for age z-score. Scores at both ages predicted crude increases in height for age
      z-score, although this relationship was weaker for adolescents. After adjustment for
      confounders only the early childhood score was significantly related height for age z-score,
      and only when mother's had greater than 6 y of education. In the crude longitudinal model,
      combined score increases did not predict ultimate height improvements. This research provides
      important insights about how diversity scores may be improved for international malnutrition
      screening, and provides a basis for future research on the performance of diversity scores
      across childhood.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Research that has examined the language produced by children with complex
      communication needs (CCN) suggests that these children frequently struggle to develop mature
      language skills. This study is the first study in the field of Augmentative and Alternative
      Communication (AAC) to consider the parallels that exist between learning to write and
      learning to use an AAC system, and the potential application that typical written language
      development has for children with CCN. Both groups of children confront the challenge of
      taking language that is inside their heads and translating it into an expressive form, using
      an instrument that is not second-nature to them. The cognitive, memory, and physical demands
      of such a process have obvious ramifications for the quantity and quality of the language
      produced. This study analyzes the language used by typically developing early-elementary
      children in North Carolina and New Zealand when they write about self-selected topics. The
      findings of this study document school age and country-related differences in the vocabulary
      words, semantic themes, and syntactic and morphological structures used by typically
      developing children. School age comparisons highlight the restricted language abilities of
      children in the earliest stages of writing development and country comparisons reveal
      differences in areas such as core vocabulary and clausal and phrasal diversity. The findings
      of this study provide much needed information regarding the developmental nature of language
      use in written language. This information will be relevant to speech-language pathologists,
      teachers, and other professionals as they engage in selecting, prioritizing, and organizing
      language in children's AAC systems.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Using a repeated-measures design, this study examined the addition of toy props during
      storybook reading between caregivers and their young children 18-27 months of age. Twelve
      children identified as demonstrating "high engagement" and 12 children
      identified as demonstrating "low engagement" during storybook interactions
      and their caregivers were recruited to participate. Group membership was based on a researcher
      developed literacy attitude and behavior questionnaire completed by the participating
      caregiver. Caregiver-child dyads were video-recorded on two occasions at their home reading
      two different storybooks and engaging in a "favorite" activity. Toy props
      were included during one of the storybook interactions, counterbalanced across participants.
      The results of the study revealed significant group differences between prop conditions for
      the total interaction time and the rate of child protesting behaviors. Additionally a trend
      was identified between dyads in the high and low engagement groups for both the total number
      of child verbal/vocal acts and total child gesture use. Specifically there was a differential
      influence for the addition of toy props dependent on engagement group membership with children
      in the low engagement group producing more verbal/vocal acts and gestures during the prop
      condition than the no prop condition. In contrast, children in the high engagement group
      tended to produce few verbal/vocal acts and gestures during the prop condition compared to the
      no prop condition.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injury is one of the most commonly seen
      injuries in sports with an estimated total cost for treatment over $2 billion per year. To
      prevent non-contact ACL injuries, several possible risk factors have been proposed. No studies
      to date, however, have shown conclusive evidence that any of the proposed risk factors are
      indeed risk factors for sustaining non-contact ACL injuries. In this study, a sagittal plane
      knee model was developed to enhance the understanding of the effects of sagittal plane
      biomechanics on the ACL loading. Knee geometry data were obtained from x-ray films of 10 male
      and 10 female collegiate aged recreational athletes. The patellar tendon-tibial shaft angle,
      patella-patellar tendon angle, quadriceps tendon-patella angle, and hamstring tendon-tibial
      shaft angle were expressed as functions of knee flexion angle, and incorporated into the
      sagittal plane knee model to estimate the ACL loading. In vivo lower extremity kinematic and
      kinetic data of a stop-jump task collected from 80 college aged recreational athletes were
      used for computer simulation with the sagittal plane knee model. A stochastic biomechanical
      model was developed and used to determine the risk and risk factors of sustaining non-contact
      ACL injuries during landing of the stop-jump task. The results of the computer simulation with
      sagittal plane inverse dynamic knee model showed that the lower extremity sagittal plane
      biomechanics simulated did affect the ACL loading. The results of the stochastic biomechanical
      model presented that females had higher risk of non-contact ACL injuries than males did. The
      gender difference in the risk of non-contact ACL injuries was affected by the differences in
      the lower extremity motion patterns, ACL ultimate load, and knee anatomy between genders.
      Biomechanical characteristics during the stop-jump task were significantly different between
      injured and uninjured jumps or between females and males. During the stop-jump task, the
      isolated sagittal plane loading alone can injure the ACL while the isolated non-sagittal plane
      loading alone may not. Knee flexion angle and peak posterior ground reaction force are two
      important risk factors for the gender difference in the risk of non-contact ACL injuries
      during the stop-jump task.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>A link between cardiopulmonary disease and increased susceptibility to particulate
      matter (PM) exposure exists, however the mechanistic link remains undefined. To investigate
      this, we compared the cardiopulmonary response of SHR, SHRSP and WKY rats to oil combustion PM
      exposure. Male rats (12-15 wks age) were intratracheally instilled with saline or 1.11, 3.33
      or 8.33 mg/kg of PM. Pulmonary injury was induced in all strains, and pulmonary leakage was
      exacerbated in SHRSP. No exposure related lesions were noted in the hearts of either WKY or
      SHRSP. Changes in levels of ferritin, antioxidants and mitochondrial enzymes seen in the
      hearts of SHRSP only suggest a cardiac effect in this strain only. These data suggest SHRSP
      are slightly more susceptible than WKY and SHR to PM induced pulmonary vascular leakage and
      cardiac oxidative stress. Additionally, translocation of PM associated metals from lungs to
      systemic circulation may be playing a role in injury causation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Apurinic/apyrimidinic (abasic) sites are some of the most common lesions found in DNA.
      They are postulated to be intermediates of mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. Each human genome
      can have as many as 104 abasic sites per day. It is therefore important to be able to
      quantitate the number of these sites. Abasic sites are quantitated by an aldehyde reactive
      probe (ARP) assay highly specific for the aldehyde group of the ring-opened d-ribose. This
      assay is based on formation of a Schiff base adduct of a hydroxylamine on the probe end of the
      aldehyde. The purpose of this project is to synthesize new ARPs that enhance reactivity
      without loss of specificity. A two-step synthetic scheme was devised to give a compound which
      replaces the hydroxylamine group with a hydrazino group expected to be more reactive. A
      long-chain ARP containing a polyethylene glycol moiety was also synthesized.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Traditionally scholars tried to explain the formation of the Berlin-Tokyo Axis using
      structural factors derived from the totalitarian, Marxist and latecomer theories. While these
      frameworks pinpoint the similarities between Japan and Germany, they do not shed light on the
      timing of the alliance and downplayed potential obstacles such as Nazi racism against
      non-Aryans, Japanese nationalistic anti-Western rhetoric, and the two countries' conflicting
      economic interests. In view of the shortcomings of the previous approaches, this essay
      examines interwar Japanese and German newspapers to gauge how the two countries portrayed each
      other. Evidence strongly indicates that while Germany and Japan exhibited interests in the
      other's culture, society and economy, they did not depict each other as a predestined ally but
      merely saw it as one nation among many and even frequently attacked its policies. These
      findings suggest that contingent, not structural, causes led to Japanese-German rapprochement.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis explores the issue of Korean reunification and how education policy might
      shape a future unified Korea. The guiding conceptual framework is John Dewey's concept of
      democracy. Moreover, by looking at the education systems of both South and North Korea,
      educational problems that are pertinent for reunification are described. Through the analysis
      and discussion of the two current systems, the shape of education in a future reunified Korea
      is suggested. The conclusion brings focus to the importance of democracy and education reform
      in order to prevent future conflict that mig ht occur following reunification.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Research has suggested that listening to preferred music may be helpful in increasing
      exercise enjoyment, positive mood, and endurance enhancement. This survey research aimed to
      explore the reasons why people listen to their personal stereo while engaged in physical
      activity, and to understand the effect this has on their level of enjoyment. Three hundred and
      forty six students participated in this study via convenience sampling. Participants were
      divided into groups depending on their active usage of a personal stereo. The Physical
      Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) was administered as the instrument. An independent-samples t
      test comparing the PACES mean scores of the Non-Personal Stereo and the Personal Stereo groups
      found a significant difference between the two groups (t(322)= -5.338, p&lt; .0005).
      Participants in the Personal Stereo group reported that they felt more energized, they enjoyed
      their experiences more, and that they preferred being in control of the music they listened
      to. Overall the results suggested that that listening to self-selected music can enhance
      individuals’ physical activity enjoyment.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation considers how three new religious movements-the Hare Krishnas,
      Unification Church, and Heaven's Gate-treated the concept of science and the relation of
      science to religion and the wider society. Each of the three religions offered a distinct
      position on the nature of science and how religion and science ought to interact. All of the
      three new religions understood their views of science as crucial to their wider theological
      views and social stances. And, in each of these new religious movements, the nature and
      meaning of science served a central role in the group's self-understanding and
      conceptualization. Because the roles and boundaries of science so concerned each of the
      groups, their founders, leaders, and ordinary members offered both implicit and explicit
      re-envisionings of science. These views developed out of each group's historical circumstances
      and theological positions, but also evolved in concert with concurrent social developments and
      cultural influences. Such varying factors resulted in three different perspectives on science.
      The Unification Church aimed to guide science and the American scientific establishment. It
      positioned science as a sphere separate from religion, yet at the same time attempted to
      direct science's ethical boundaries, methods, and even research goals. The Hare Krishnas
      sought to replace Western science with an alternative scientific-religious system rooted in
      their own Hindu religious tradition. The science of ancient Indian religious texts, they
      insisted, offered a more accurate and socially healthy paradigm than that of the contemporary
      American scientific establishment. Heaven's Gate attempted to absorb or incorporate science
      and scientific elements into their religious system. It looked to methodological materialism
      and naturalism as the ideal epistemology, and declared itself the truest form of science.
      Taken together, the manner in which the three new religious movements responded to the power,
      prestige, and place of science in America demonstrates the multiple ways that religious groups
      can incorporate creative tension with science into their broader intellectual positions. The
      three groups emerged from different cultural and historical circumstances, yet they each
      insisted that religion could respond to science with neither warfare nor surrender.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Teacher leadership is a relatively new construct. Most of the literature has been
      theoretically based with few focusing on teachers' thinking around teacher leadership and even
      fewer talking to teachers. Also, most research studies have looked at teacher leadership in
      the elementary school and without concentration on a specific content area. This study
      attempts to broaden the literature by talking to secondary mathematics teachers about teacher
      leadership. The research question that guided this study was How do secondary mathematics
      teachers define, perceive, and enact teacher leadership? Participants included twelve
      secondary mathematics teachers who graduated from the same Masters of Education program.
      Predominantly qualitative in nature and using a phenomenological lens, the study followed the
      teachers for one-year after completing the program. Data collection included a teacher
      leadership narrative, a pre- and post-teacher leader survey, three individual interviews and
      two focus groups. The teachers were grouped and placed along a teacher leader continuum. Then,
      sociotransformative constructivism (Rodriguez, 1998) provided the theoretical framework with
      which to view the teachers' words. The four elements of sociotransformative constructivism
      (dialogic conversation, authentic activity, metacognition, and reflexivity) provided a
      framework with which to delve deeper into the teachers' thinking about teacher leadership.
      Teacher definitions of teacher leadership broadened throughout the year and most, having
      started the year with a somewhat clear idea of teacher leadership, completed the year feeling
      overwhelmed by its vastness. Teacher perceptions of teacher leadership fell along a continuum
      stretching from visible but not noisy to instigator creating conflict. Much like teaching,
      teachers did not see teacher leadership as a stagnant ideal to be reached, but one that
      changed based on the situation. Whereas one situation may call a teacher leader to be visible
      but not noisy, another situation may call for the same teacher leader to be an instigator
      creating conflict. As teachers' ideas of teacher leadership broadened throughout the year,
      their enactments also expanded and covered a wide range of activities and roles.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Most RNAs function only once they fold to form difficult-to-predict base-paired
      helices and other structural elements. As an RNA forms a preferred secondary or tertiary
      structure, a characteristic set of nucleotides becomes constrained by base pairing and
      higher-order interactions, while unconconstrained positions remain flexible. Determining local
      nucleotide flexibility as a function of nucleotide position in a folded RNA provides important
      information that enables the sequence and structure of an RNA to be related to its biological
      function. I have developed a technology, termed selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by
      primer extension (SHAPE), that can be used to interrogate RNA structure under diverse in vitro
      and in vivo conditions. SHAPE chemistry can be applied to monitor protein binding events and
      locate promising sites for primer annealing in arbitrary RNA. SHAPE chemistry is based on the
      discovery that flexible RNA nucleotides preferentially sample conformations that enhance the
      nucleophilic reactivity of the 2'-hydroxyl group toward electrophiles, such as N-methylisatoic
      anhydride. Modified sites are detected as stops in an optimized DNA primer extension reaction,
      followed by sizing of the extension products. SHAPE chemistry scores local flexibility at all
      four ribonucleotides in a single experiment and discriminates between base-paired versus
      unconstrained residues with a dynamic range of 20-fold or greater. I have applied SHAPE
      chemistry to observe equilibrium melting of a model tRNA at single nucleotide resolution. I
      observed that RNA folding is a complex process involving structural rearrangement and the
      formation of tertiary structure concurrent with secondary structure. Furthermore, I have
      employed capillary electrophoresis and sophisticated analysis algorithms to create a
      high-throughput SHAPE (hSHAPE) experiment that can comprehensively interrogate the flexibility
      of several hundred nucleotides in a single robust experiment. Using hSHAPE, I analyzed the
      structure of HIV-1 genomic RNA as a function of 4 different biologically relevant states,
      including infectious viral particles. Despite many thermodynamically plausible structures, the
      HIV-1 genome exists in a single conformation. I observed the effects of tRNA primer binding,
      and the effects of nucleocapsid protein on RNA flexibility. hSHAPE chemistry is a promising,
      scalable approach that can rapidly and accurately analyze the structure of RNA molecules under
      biologically relevant conditions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Among the most common rituals in Japan, the Buddhist post-pregnancy loss ritual mizuko
      kuyo has come to America. Mizuko kuyo first arrived in Japanese-American Buddhist communities.
      Temples of various denominations demonstrate a range of attitudes and practices related to
      mizuko kuyo. The ritual is particularly sought out by new Japanese immigrants, and is largely
      contextualized by Japanese Buddhist notions of the spirit world and clear distinctions between
      priests and laypeople. What changes occur in mizuko kuyo are generally the result of indirect
      forces, such as lack of space. Convert Zen practitioners in America also practice a form of
      mizuko kuyo, often called "water baby ceremonies." Despite their depiction
      as unritualistic, since the early 1990s these new Buddhist groups have increasingly taken up
      mizuko kuyo as a practice to help members deal with pregnancy losses. Women have been the
      pioneers of this practice, which is buttressed by the rise of bodhisattva-oriented movements.
      Numerous alterations can be seen in the process of recreating mizuko kuyo as water baby
      ceremonies. Among the most important is the re-orientation from placating the spirit to
      psychologically healing the parent. The rise of mizuko kuyo demonstrates that convert Zen has
      reached a new stage which pays greater attention to ritual and other elements of the tradition
      left out by earlier American converts. Thus mizuko kuyo pushes these groups closer to Asian
      models. Buddhists are not the only Americans with an interest in mizuko kuyo. Pro-life and
      pro-choice proponents rhetorically appropriate mizuko kuyo in ways designed to bolster their
      political positions. Pro-life adherents use mizuko kuyo to prove that they care about women,
      and that their convictions arise from objective psychological phenomena. Prochoice proponents
      use it to show that they care about families, and that they are sensitive to the religious
      aspects of abortion. More surprising, some American Christians and others seek healing after
      pregnancy losses through mizuko kuyo. These ritual appropriations come in many forms, from
      discussing Buddhism in online forums to performing mizuko kuyo. Buddhism may be becoming the
      specialist religion that ministers to post-pregnancy loss grief for many Americans, regardless
      of their personal religious affiliation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation examines the phenomenon of bilateral investment treaties, or BITs.
      Developing countries have increasingly turned to these treaties as a means of offering
      credible promises to foreign investors of favorable treatment, ostensibly in order to induce
      greater investment flows. My analysis is three-pronged. First, I argue that only certain kinds
      of BITs are likely to have much of an effect on investment flows-namely, those that contain
      binding state pre-consents to investor-initiated arbitration. I present the first
      comprehensive analysis of the dispute-settlement content of existing treaties. This
      data-collection effort informs the statistical analyses presented in later chapters. Second, I
      argue that the willingness of developing countries to enter into BITs should depend in
      predictable ways on the partisan character of their governing elites. I present results from a
      large-n statistical analysis that shows that partisanship indeed matters in predicting the
      likelihood that BITs will be embraced as a mechanism to attract foreign investment. Finally, I
      present a large-n statistical analysis of the effectiveness of BITs at attracting additional
      foreign investment. I find very limited evidence that strong BITs are of much use in the
      so-called "competition for capital". The finding is of great potential
      significance to developing countries, who have in the past appeared to blindly embrace BITs as
      a significant part of their development strategies. My results suggest that while BITs may be
      likely to impose significant sovereignty costs on developing countries, they are unlikely to
      provide much in the way of off-setting benefits.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this dissertation, we study the Hausdorff dimension and measures of full Hausdorff
      dimension for a compact invariant set of an expanding nonconformal map on the torus given by
      an integer-valued diagonal matrix. The Hausdorff dimension of a "general Sierpinski
      carpet" was found byMcMullen and Bedford and the uniqueness of the measure of full
      Hausdorff dimension in some cases was proved by Kenyon and Peres. We extend these results by
      considering a general Sierpinski carpet represented by a shift of finite type. Applying
      results of Ledrappier, Young, and Shin, we study the Hausdorff dimension of such a general
      Sierpinski carpet for the case when there is a saturated compensation function. We give some
      conditions under which a general Sierpinski carpet has a unique measure of full Hausdorff
      dimension and study the properties of the unique measure.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Numerous constructs have been proposed to describe the transitional state between
      normal aging and dementia, but no one set of criteria is consistently referred to as the
      prodrome to dementia. Although there are many studies of the rates of these constructs,
      results are hampered by methodological differences. Research examining the overlap and
      stability of these constructs over time is also lacking, and predictive utility for later
      dementia remains inconclusive. Moreover, it is unknown whether one construct is superior in
      predicting later dementia or Alzheimer's disease. The current study addressed these issues
      using longitudinal clinical and neuropsychological data from a subsample (N=661) of
      participants in an epidemiological study of aging and dementia, the Cache County Memory Study
      (CCMS). Results confirmed wide variability in rates of preclinical dementia constructs.
      Constructs that included measures of functional impairment were the most stable, whereas
      constructs relying on memory impairment were generally unstable. Using bivariate logistic
      regression, four of the seven constructs were associated with later dementia, and these
      constructs either measured multiple cognitive domains or functional impairment. The 'Mild
      Ambiguous' construct, which includes memory or functional impairment, was statistically
      superior in predicting later dementia. Although four of the seven constructs were also
      significant predictors of later AD, no one construct was superior.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>All animals require a skeletal support system for posture and locomotion. Arthropods,
      however, repeatedly shed their rigid exoskeleton in order to grow, yet they maintain shape and
      mobility during these periods. My research focuses on this apparent paradox and suggests that
      crabs, and possibly all arthropods, alternate between a rigid and a hydrostatic (fluid-based)
      skeleton in order to remain functional during molting. I tested for the use of hydrostatic
      skeletal support in blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus, by simultaneously measuring internal
      hydrostatic pressure and force of claw adduction. I found a strong correlation between force
      and hydrostatic pressure in soft-shell crabs, but not in hard-shell crabs, which is consistent
      with the use of hydrostatic support during molting. Switching skeletons requires a change in
      function of the cuticle, from resisting primarily bending, compression, and torsion, to
      resisting tension. This change in function implies correlated changes in the properties of the
      cuticle. I tested the mechanical properties of the cuticle throughout the molt cycle of C.
      sapidus and found that the flexural and tensile stiffness is greater in hard cuticle than soft
      cuticle, but the tensile strength is the same. The blackback land crab, Gecarcinus lateralis,
      does not molt in water and inflates its gut with air during molting, which may serve as a
      support mechanism. I simultaneously measured the force of claw flexion, hydrostatic pressure
      within the claw, and gas pressure within the gut. I obtained a strong correlation between all
      three measurements, which suggests that the gas helps maintain turgidity throughout the body,
      and thus acts as a critical component of the skeleton. Rigid and hydrostatic skeletons operate
      according to different principles and each is likely to be influenced by scale in distinct
      ways. Using morphological techniques, I found that cuticle thickness scales isometrically for
      rigid skeletons but allometrically for hydrostatic skeletons, suggesting that both play a role
      in determining growth to maximum size in crabs. This research provides novel insights into how
      skeletal support systems influence the way in which animals are built, develop, and function.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Photon mapping is a popular global illumination algorithm that can reproduce a wide
      range of visual effects including indirect illumination, color bleeding and caustics on
      complex diffuse, glossy, and specular surfaces modeled using arbitrary geometric primitives.
      However, the large amount of computation and tremendous amount of memory bandwidth, terabytes
      per second, required makes photon mapping prohibitively expensive for interactive
      applications. In this dissertation I present three techniques that work together to reduce the
      bandwidth requirements of photon mapping by over an order of magnitude. These are combined in
      a hardware architecture that can provide interactive performance on moderatelysized
      indirectly-illuminated scenes using a pre-computed photon map. 1. The computations of the
      naive photon map algorithm are efficiently reordered, generating exactly the same image, but
      with an order of magnitude less bandwidth due to an easily cacheable sequence of memory
      accesses. 2. The irradiance caching algorithm is modified to allow fine-grain parallel
      execution by removing the sequential dependency between pixels. The bandwidth requirements of
      scenes with diffuse surfaces and low geometric complexity is reduced by an additional 40% or
      more. 3. Generating final gather rays in proportion to both the incident radiance and the
      reflectance functions requires fewer final gather rays for images of the same quality.
      Combined Importance Sampling is simple to implement, cheap to compute, compatible with query
      reordering, and can reduce bandwidth requirements by an order of magnitude. Functional
      simulation of a practical and scalable hardware architecture based on these three techniques
      shows that an implementation that would fit within a host workstation will achieve interactive
      rates. This architecture is therefore a candidate for the next generation of graphics
      hardware.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>From the perspective of the sociology of language developed by Joshua Fishman, and
      working from letters, newspapers, secondary accounts, and grave inscriptions, this study
      describes and explains bilingualism and the loss of the Dutch language in two West Michigan
      Dutch immigrant communities from 1847-1930, the Reformed Church (RCA) Dutch and the Christian
      Reformed Church (CRC) Dutch. The loss of Dutch in some ways parallels the contemporaneous
      language shift of Norwegian immigrants (Haugen, 1969) and Swedish immigrants (Karstadt, 2002).
      The two West Michigan Dutch Calvinist communities were unique in their language shift
      experiences. The RCA Dutch experienced and promoted a rapid assimilation and shift to English.
      The CRC Dutch promoted a multi-generational maintenance of the Dutch language in a stable
      Dutch- English bilingual setting-the preservation of Dutch was not at the expense of the
      acquisition of English-and then consciously and abruptly abandoned the Dutch language in the
      years immediately after World War I. The CRC Dutch maintained their language for so long
      precisely because it was the marker of identity for them and it was inextricably tied to their
      faith; the RCA Dutch were able to abandon the Dutch language early on because it was not the
      marker of religious identity for them.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This theory-based evaluation was conducted on pretest-posttest data collected from an
      efficacy trial of the Making Choices (MC) program, a universal intervention designed to
      prevent conduct problems. This study examined three areas of inquiry. First, program effects
      on social information-processing (SIP) skills and overt aggression were evaluated. Next,
      program-by-gender interactions were tested. Lastly, indirect effects were tested to evaluate
      whether effects on theoretical mediators, in part, explained program success. MC and MC+ were
      expected to result in decreased overt aggression and improved SIP skills, and gender was
      expected to moderate these effects. SIP skills were expected to partially mediate program
      effects on overt aggression. The study utilized a non-randomized, cohort design with treatment
      withdrawal. The sample consists of three ethnically-diverse cohorts of third graders (N=480;
      50% female) from two rural elementary schools. The 2001-02 cohort (n=156) participated in MC,
      the 2002-03 cohort (n=193) participated in MC+, an augmented version of MC. After a one-year
      treatment withdrawal period, data were collected from a routine-services cohort (2004-05;
      n=131). On average, intervention students made greater improvements than comparison students
      on all outcomes. MC students demonstrated better encoding, emotion regulation, and response
      selection. MC+ students had less hostile attribution bias and better emotion regulation and
      response selection. MC and MC+ boys had less overt aggression and more benign social goals
      than comparison boys. MC+ girls also experienced improvements on these outcomes, though
      improvements were modest. Effect sizes for SIP skills varied in magnitude from small to
      medium, and large effects on overt aggression were obtained for boys. Three out of five SIP
      skills (i.e., goal clarification, response selection, and emotion regulation) appeared to
      explain program effects on overt aggression. Effects on social cognition were consistent with
      study hypotheses. Large effects on overt aggression suggest that SIP-based programs may be
      particularly effective at preventing conduct problems in boys. Mediation findings suggest that
      effects on SIP skills explained program effects. Intervention research examining mediation and
      moderation can help us to achieve a better understanding of "what works" and
      "for whom," improving our capacity to prevent problem behavior in youth.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The current study examined a mediational model of social support as the mechanism of
      change in a couple-based treatment for dietary behavior among patients with coronary heart
      disease. None of the assumptions of mediation regarding social support were met. Treatment
      condition (individual versus couple) did not predict changes in social support or changes in
      diet. Changes in social support did not predict changes in diet, possibly due to the lack of
      significant change in social support from pre to post treatment. Considering social support as
      a stable characteristic of partners, post hoc analyses examined social support as a moderator
      of treatment's effects on diet. Results demonstrated that patients in the individual treatment
      condition whose partners provided higher amounts of expressive support showed lower increases
      in percent of calories from fat. In addition, patients in the individual treatment condition
      whose partners provided higher positive affect during social support showed greater increases
      in percent of calories from fat and saturated fat. In addition to examining the role of social
      support in a couple-based treatment for health behavior change, the current study revised and
      applied a coding system for social support in couples to discussions about one partner's

               <mods:abstract>The progressive country music movement developed in Austin, Texas, during the early
      1970s as a community of liberal young musicians and concertgoers with strong interests in
      Texan country music traditions and contemporary rock music converged on the city. Children of
      the Cold War and the post-World War II migration to the suburbs, these "cosmic
      cowboys" sought to get back in touch with their rural roots and to leave behind the
      socially conservative world their parents had created for them. As a hybrid of country music
      and rock, progressive country music both encapsulated the contradictions of the cosmic cowboys
      in song and helped to create a musical sanctuary in which these youths could articulate their
      difference from mainstream Texan culture. Examining the work of the movement's
      singer-songwriters (Michael Murphey, Guy Clark, Gary P. Nunn), western swing revivalists
      (Asleep at the Wheel, Alvin Crow and the Pleasant Valley Boys), and commercial country singers
      (Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings), this dissertation explores the proliferation of stock
      imagery, landscape painting, and Texan stereotypes in progressive country music and their role
      in the construction of Austin's difference. These traits reveal fundamental challenges
      confronted by the cosmic cowboy generation: rapid urban-industrial growth that could be
      countered by escaping to the rural countryside, a hippie counterculture thought to be either
      in its last throes or, in contradictory interpretations, on the verge of its zenith, and a
      mainstream culture whose ignorance or stubbornness stood in the way of a countercultural
      utopia. Through analysis of source recordings, this dissertation also investigates the
      influence of commercial songwriting and recording practices on Austin's progressive country
      music and establishes the city's musical community in a larger network of commercial musicians
      in Nashville, Los Angeles, and New York. As such, progressive country music in Austin embodied
      the contradictions felt by the cosmic cowboys as they attempted to forge a place and identity
      for themselves in Texas in the 1970s.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation provides a radical re-examination of literary scholarship that
      associates the experimental fiction written in Spanish America during the 1940s through the
      late 1970s with European (post-)modernism. This type of scholarship often finds support in
      Joyce's "influence" on the aesthetics of the so-called Spanish American
      "new narrative." I establish the necessary critical conditions to contest
      the assimilation of this narrative to Anglo-American modernism via Joyce by contextualizing
      the reception of the Irish writer's modernist aesthetics within the discursive framework of
      the cultural decolonization taking place in Spanish America and the Third World during the
      years of gestation and flourishing of the new narrative. This contextualization not only
      reveals the decolonizing potential of Joyce's prose when interpreted by Spanish American
      intellectuals writing in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s (a potential that has gained critical
      attention in the Anglo-American academy only over the last decade). It also takes decisive
      steps towards reconstructing a context for the literary production of
      "Joycean" authors such as Leopoldo Marechal, Jorge Luis Borges, Julio
      Cortázar, José Lezama Lima, Guillermo Cabrera Infante, and Fernando del Paso that does not
      necessarily link them to the development of European literature. From this perspective, I
      argue that the textual parallels between Joyce and these six authors configure a transatlantic
      aesthetic nodal point that stands in polemic dialogue with modernity as a philosophical
      paradigm and with Eurocentric literary history as a globalizing discourse.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Visual attention serves to select, from amongst a huge influx of visual information,
      an item or location to receive greater processing. This focus of attention can be directed
      voluntarily or it can be reflexively captured by a sudden onset or movement. In recent years
      another type of attentional orienting has been studied: "social gaze
      orienting". In this type of orienting, the gaze of another person automatically
      causes one's attention to shift in the direction of the gaze. While this attentional shift is
      automatic in nature, its properties differ from those typically associated with reflexive
      orienting, especially on terms of the timing of facilitation effects. The relations between
      social gaze cueing, voluntary cuing, and reflexive cueing are not well understood. The current
      study explores the similarities and differences between the neural mechanisms of these types
      of orienting using event-related potentials (ERPs). ERPs allow us to explore differences in
      the neural underpinnings of voluntary, reflexive, and social gaze orienting that may or may
      not be exhibited in overt behavior. In Experiment 1, it was discovered that a localization
      task at cue-target SOAs of 50-250 and 300-500ms was able to produce significant effects on
      behavior. In Experiment 2, when timing was the same for each type of attention (an SOA of
      300-500ms), behavioral and early visual ERP effects were similar for social and voluntary
      attention, but reflexive attention showed a different pattern. In Experiment 3, when timing is
      varied for each type of attention, producing the strongest effects on behavior, greater
      differences between social and voluntary cuing emerged, as social attention no longer showed
      any significant effects on early visual ERPs. In both ERP experiments social attention showed
      increased amplitude for invalid targets on late negative component peaking around 420ms after
      the target. For reflexive and voluntary attention, in both experiments, this effect is either
      absent or reversed suggesting that continued processing that occurs after target response is
      distinct for social attention. These new findings suggest that while more similar to voluntary
      attention, social attention shows distinct processing at some levels, suggesting it should not
      be considered equivalent to reflexive or voluntary attention.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Research on the area of the fabrication of carbon nanotubes is fundamental and
      critical to the entire subject of carbon nanotubes. This dissertation describes an experiment
      to fabricate carbon nanotubes by the method of Microwave Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor
      Deposition (MPECVD) and the electron field emission properties of carbon nanotubes. A MPECVD
      system was built and used to fabricate the vertical aligned carbon nanotube film. Scanning
      electron microscope (SEM), Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were
      used to characterize the as-grown carbon nanotube samples. By using a metal-containing diblock
      copolymer catalyst, carbon nanotubes with a diameter of 4 to 7 nm were synthesized. The effect
      of growth parameters was studied and these parameters were optimized. The growth of high
      density (~ 10superscript 9/cm squared) and large coverage area (~ 1 cm squared) carbon
      nanotube film on glass substrate at low growth temperature was realized. Based on a series of
      experiments, the effects of oxygen atoms and Ti/N underlayer on the growth were studied. A
      series of experiments were evaluated to characterize the field emission properties of the
      various carbon nanotube cathodes. A simple technique of scratching the pattern surface by a
      cotton swab was found effective to activate more carbon nanotubes to emit. By using the
      techniques of photolithography and shadow mask, various carbon nanotube patterns were achieved
      in order to obtain high emission current density and a low threshold electric field. The
      lowest threshold electric field was found to be 2.3 V/um. The highest current density was
      found to be 2.2 mA/cm squared when the electric field was 4.7 V/um. Our work shows that it is
      feasible to provide greater control over the fabrication of carbon nanotubes so that more
      obstacles in the broad application of carbon nanotubes can be overcome.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Gabriela Mistral, the first Spanish-American Nobel Laureate, is best known as a poet
      and prose writer; even though it is widely recognized that her writings are didactic in
      nature. Little has been written concerning her ideas and how she conveyed them through her
      writings. This dissertation seeks to open a space that will respond to a need for a
      consideration of her contributions as a teacher who endeavored to enrich the lives of women
      and those who had limited educational opportunities. Emphasis is placed on her collaboration
      with the Mexican poet and Secretary of Education José Vasconcelos, in Mexico's modernization
      of its educational system, in particular on behalf of women and the rural areas. In chapter 1,
      I provide the introductory information with "Some Thoughts on Gabriela Mistral and
      Education." In chapter 2, Gabriela Mistral's educational philosophy, in the light of
      her career as an author and a teacher, briefly sketching her familial and education
      background, is discussed. Chile and Mexico's impact on her life, both in the sense of the
      Constitution and the system, is the focal point of chapter 3. Chapter 4 examines her use of
      poetry and fiction as educational tools. Three main texts have been analyzed: two poems from
      Gabriela Mistral's Desolación, "Decálogo del artista" and "La
      maestra rural," as well as selected prose and poems from Mistral and other authors
      she anthologized in her textbook Lecturas para mujeres. The fifth chapter studies the meaning
      of the Colegio Industrial "Gabriela Mistral" in the poet's life and
      educational career. The hymn that Mistral wrote for this school, and a bulletin issued by the
      Colegio Industrial "Gabriela Mistral," served as the points of reference to
      evaluate the strength of the Chilean author-educator's contributions to the renovation of the
      educational opportunities for the women of Mexico.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Traditionally, Romanticism has been viewed as a movement at odds with early
      nineteenthcentury scientific developments. By examining Romantic-era philosophies of
      literature and science through the lens of medical poetry by both canonical and unpublished
      British and American writers, I argue that medical poetry (poetry by medical practitioners and
      patients) significantly contributed to the rise of medicine. Through its emphasis on status,
      sympathy, clinical detachment, and patients' agency, it laid down many of the discipline's
      epistemological foundations. While critics have examined poems by well-known medical
      practitioners like John Keats and George Crabbe, mine is the first comprehensive scholarly
      analysis of this genre.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>"A Bride of One Night, a Widow Forever" is a multidisciplinary
      ethnographic study of Shi'i hagiographical texts and performances in the South Indian city of
      Hyderabad where on 7 Muharram, the Shi'a commemorate the marriage between eleven year-old
      Fatimah Kubra and thirteen year-old Qasem at the battle of Karbala, Iraq in 680 CE. Taking the
      wedding of Fatimah Kubra and Qasem as a paradigmatic example, this dissertation examines the
      pivotal function of hagiography or sacred biography as it mediates local social values and
      defines gendered action through public performance in the majlis mourning assembly. Employing
      a theoretical framework of complementary pairing that is influenced by structuralism, this
      project demonstrates that sainthood in Shi'i Islam exists in two complementary pairs, which
      creates a space for both local culture and gendered practices to be articulated through the
      example of the members of the third Shi'i Imam Husain's family. "A Bride of One
      Night" engages both the archive to trace the transformation of the Qasem-Kubra
      wedding into a Deccani-Indian idiom, and ethnographic fieldwork focused on the mourning
      assemblies, thus drawing into relief a form of sainthood based upon the veneration of Imam
      Husain's family or ?usainiyyat. Through the literature and performance of the majlis, the
      gendered dimension of this sainthood is expressed through the prominence of Imam Husain's
      female relatives who are venerated by the Shi'a as saints. Judith Butler's theory of gendered
      embodiment-through clothing, mannerisms and speech-integrated with a theory of complementary
      pairing, articulates a dynamically embodied form of Shi'i sainthood. In the context of the
      Hyderabadi majlis mourning assembly, Fatimah Kubra is re-presented in the form a structural
      dyad, that of the fortunebearing bride and the inauspicious widow. Fatimah Kubra embodies the
      idealized bride- obedient and beautiful in her wedding finery, and she is the model
      widow-unadorned and detached from the world. In this model of hagiography, Kubra
      simultaneously embodies a dually gendered, idealized, Hyderabadi Indian Shi'i Muslim woman.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this dissertation, I use the lens of captivity to explore how Native Southerners
      defined themselves and the other. Before they encountered one another in the colonial era, the
      peoples of Africa, Europe, and North America considered enslavement a legitimate fate for
      captured enemy peoples, though their attitudes about the status and roles of captives
      differed. In the South during the colonial and early national periods, violent conflict often
      erupted as Indian nations labored to maintain their territorial integrity and political
      autonomy, Euro-Americans desired to control Indian land and African labor, and Africans sought
      freedom. During such episodes, Native groups took enemies-white, black, and Indian-as
      captives. Victors then subjected their captives to a variety of fates: they ritually killed
      some to satisfy the demands of clan vengeance; they adopted others to replace deceased family
      members; they made chattel slaves out of the remainder. Throughout the colonial period, Native
      Southerners largely determined a captive's fate based on his or her sex and age. By the late
      eighteenth century, however, race became a captive's most salient characteristic, and
      African-American captives were overwhelmingly targeted in warfare and then sold or held in
      transgenerational bondage. This study, in part, explores why that shift toward racialization
      occurred, and how it reflected Native Southerners' changing sense of identity. More broadly,
      "Captives of the Dark and Bloody Ground" addresses the construction of race
      and racism in America and contributes to a growing body of scholarship on the diversity of
      enslavement in North America. This dissertation traces the dynamic institution of captivity
      from the precolonial past, when Native chiefdoms competed for regional power, through the
      conclusion of the Second Seminole War in 1842, which marks the final captive-taking episode in
      the contested American South. It draws upon a wide variety of English- and Spanish-language
      sources including legal documents, personal and official correspondence, journals,
      ethnographies, and the archaeological record.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In recent work, W. D. Neumann and J. Wahl construct explicit equations for many
      interesting normal surface singularities with rational homology sphere links, which they call
      splice quotients. The construction begins with the topological type of a normal surface
      singularity, that is, a good resolution graph ¡ that is a tree of rational curves. If ¡
      satisfies certain combinatorial conditions, then there exist splice quotients with resolution
      graph ¡. Let {zn = f(x, y)} define a surface Xf,n with an isolated singularity at the origin
      in C3. For f irreducible, we completely characterize, in terms of n and the Puiseux pairs of
      f, those Xf,n for which the resolution graph satisfies the combinatorial conditions defined by
      Neumann and Wahl. Briefly stated, we find that the conditions are not often satisfied.
      Furthermore, given a splice quotient (X, 0), it turns out that "equisingular
      deformations" of (X, 0) are usually not splice quotients, as we demonstrate already
      for singularities of the form {z2 = xP + yQ} with rational homology sphere link.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Transportation planners have long recognized a role for the environment in travel
      behavior, although the most effective techniques for incorporating the environment into travel
      research remain an open and active area of inquiry. A clearer understanding of the link
      between the physical environment and travel may inform planning and policy that has the
      potential to influence household travel behavior and reap tangible benefits in air quality,
      congestion management, fuel conservation, and other areas. The objectives of this research are
      1) Understand how auto ownership and travel behavior vary across physical environments 2)
      Understand direct and indirect associations between environment and travel behavior, mediated
      by auto ownership 3) Model and describe differences in environmental representations in travel
      models This work models household decisions relating to auto ownership and travel,
      specifically auto ownership, trip generation, and mode choice. Three different representations
      of the environment inform the models. These include 1) a neighborhood typology (transect)
      describing a range of development types from the intensely urban city center to rural
      greenfields; 2) factors used to generate clusters in the transect: walkability, access,
      agglomeration, industry, and property values; and 3) direct environmental measures:
      residential density, and distance to transit, commerce, and central business district. Auto
      ownership relates primarily to household factors. Trips are more sensitive than is the number
      of autos to the environment, and less sensitive to some household measures. Mode choice is
      sensitive to environmental measures; specifically, choice of the walk mode is associated with
      walkable and accessible environments, and with clusters on the more urban end of the transect.
      Trips differ by purpose, with home-based work trips sensitive to the environment but not
      socio-demographic variables, but the more discretionary other homebased trips showing the
      reverse. Comparing across environmental representations, factors prove to be more informative
      than clusters about autos and travel. The four direct measures generally are not statistically
      significant. Walk trips differ from drive trips in being sensitive to walkability and
      accessibility but not to socio-demographic variables. Path analysis shows that indirect
      effects mediated through autos are swamped by much larger direct associations of the
      environment with trips and mode choice.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation sets out to analyze a representative group of Spanish American
      naturalist novels that feature a central preoccupation with women and their social situation.
      My corpus includes Chilean Augusto D'Halmar's Juana Lucero (1902), Mexican Federico Gamboa's
      Santa (1903), Argentine Manuel Gálvez's Nacha Regules (1919), Gaucha (1899) and Beba (1894) by
      Uruguayans Javier de Viana and Carlos Reyles, respectively, and Blanca Sol (1889) and Herencia
      (1895) by Peruvians Mercedes Cabello de Carbonera and Clorinda Matto de Turner, respectively.
      My contention is that the main female characters in these novels, whether prostitutes,
      virtuous women, or adolescents, become the targets of victimization that stems from the values
      of the patriarchal society that dominates their lives. Their status as victim is above all
      driven by gender and oftentimes leads to a mental, emotional, or physical elimination from
      mainstream society. The repression of women takes many different forms and oftentimes is an
      important contributing factor to their downfall, the end result frequently being death,
      suicide, prostitution, violence, and/or other forms of degradation. While discussing the
      situations of the women, I bring into play, when appropriate, the question of space. I analyze
      the representation of the spaces, whether repressive or liberating, traversed by the female
      characters. I devote a separate chapter to each of these discussions: Sinful Spaces, which
      focuses on prostitution; Spaces of Contamination, in which I analyze the connection between
      illness and women; Spaces of Victimization, which discusses violence against women; and
      Marriage as a Victimizing Space. It is my hope to extend through this study the existing
      scholarly interest in the victimization of woman in European and other literatures by
      including the Spanish American narrative, and to offer a coherent and thorough analysis of the
      woman as victim in the naturalist novel of that region.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Sponges are potentially important drivers of nitrogen cycling on Caribbean coral reefs
      due to their capacity to filter large volumes of water, their dense microbial communities, and
      their large population size. Given the potential role that nitrogen plays in controlling
      primary production and reef health, it is important to understand and quantify the nitrogen
      fluxes between sponges, their associated microbial communities, and the surrounding water
      column. The main goal of this dissertation is to characterize the role of sponges and their
      microbial assiciates in reef N cycling, specifically: 1) to quantify the flux of dissolved
      inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to the water column, 2) to investigate the process of nitrification,
      and 3) to measure nitrogen fixation rates in sponges. Nitrogen fixation rates in sponges were
      found to be very low relative to the ambient water column; therefore, sponge-hosted nitrogen
      fixation probably does not contribute significantly to sponge nutrition or to inputs of new
      nitrogen for the reef. However, sponges were found to be a large source of DIN. The DIN flux
      from the sponge community was measured using a combination of incubation experiments and a
      novel in situ method and found to be 660 ± 130 mol m-2 h-1, which is approximately ten times
      higher than other reported benthic nutrient fluxes. Most of this DIN is released in the form
      of nitrate due to active communities of ammonia oxidizers and nitrifiers hosted by many of the
      most abundant sponge species. At present it is unknown whether the ammoniaoxidizing community
      is dominated by archaea or bacteria, but the results of this study show that the isotopic
      fractionation and sensitivity to chemical inhibition are consistent with bacterial ammonia
      oxidizers. Because nitrogen fixation rates were negligible compared to DIN flux rates,
      spongeiii produced DIN is likely derived from the remineralization of organic matter.
      Therefore, although sponges do not appear to facilitate fluxes of new nitrogen for the reef,
      they do appear to regenerate large quantities of inorganic nutrients, and to facilitate the
      oxidation of ammonium to nitrate.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The character and mechanism of small vulcanian eruptions, often seen in andesitic
      volcanoes, have not been studied thoroughly. Activity of Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador, is
      presented here using data from a temporal deployment of broad-band seismic stations and
      infrasonic microphones. This study focuses on three areas of volcano dynamics: a) structure of
      the magmatic plumbing system, b) the process of magma fragmentation inside the volcano
      conduit, and c) propagation of infrasound waves through a real medium. Using shear wave
      splitting of regional tectonic earthquakes, we found that anisotropic structures (micro-cracks
      alignments) are approximately perpendicular to expected tectonic orientations. The
      perpendicular orientation of these structures is likely related to magma intrusions in the
      upper part of the volcano conduit. Degassing at Tungurahua is characterized by frequent
      short-duration explosions, typical of vulcanian style eruptions. Seismic and infrasound
      arrival times constrain the source of Tungurahua fragmentation to the shallowest section
      (upper 200 m) of the volcano edifice. While infrasound events cluster into families of similar
      waveforms, we found no temporal correlation nor relationship of event size with cluster
      association. The variation of amplitudes and arrival time differences between seismic and
      acoustic records suggests that either the shear fragmentation occurs at different loci inside
      the conduit, or that the seismic and acoustic signals do not share the same
      source-time-function. In contrast to previous infrasound studies on volcanoes, we analyze the
      effects of wind and rough topography on the propagation of infrasound waves. Numerical
      simulations using Finite-Difference Time-Domain methods confirm that wind has a significant
      influence on arrival times at stations around the volcano. Acoustic reduction is observed if
      infrasound is impeded by topographic barriers with dimensions similar to or larger than the
      infrasound wavelength. This research has a direct application to the important effort of
      volcano explosion monitoring and hazard reduction.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>At any given time, there are a number of issues on the media, and subsequent public,
      agenda. It is certainly arguable that, currently, stem cell research is one such issue. The
      ethical considerations surrounding stem cell research are fueling increasing debate in
      science, politics, and religion. Based on the ability of the media to set the public agenda,
      and given the fact that stem cell research provokes such vehement debate, it is crucial that
      we have a clear understanding of how the media frame stem cell research. The purpose of this
      study is not to attempt to solve the stem cell debate. Rather, this study is a framing
      analysis of both textual and photographic media coverage of stem cell research. The study
      examines both newspaper and newsmagazine coverage of stem cell research from 1998 through
      2006. The results of the study show that the political strategy frame was the dominant frame
      of nearly half of all newspaper articles, which supports the findings of previous research
      that science news tends to focus on political maneuvering rather than substantive scientific
      context. However, for news photographs, the science frame and the politics frame were both
      largely prominent. Taken as a whole, the findings indicate that political exploitation of the
      topic may be overshadowing the medical potential and ethical dimensions of stem cell research.
      Further, the findings show that scientific context was not a dominant frame of the articles,
      indicating that the political aspects of the debate are not necessarily being placed within
      sufficient scientific context to allow for the public to engage in informed public debate.
      Thus, the conclusion of the dissertation is that the media are tending to cast more heat
      (controversy) than light (understanding) on the subject of stem cell research.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Contextualized within the setting of urban development, this dissertation considers
      contemporary manifestations of international development policy alongside the work of
      chroniclers in Latin America. Specifically, this project studies the World Bank's involvement
      in Mexico City and Rio de Janeiro over the last thirty years in relation to
      chronicles--literary-journalistic writings distributed primarily through newspapers and
      magazines--written in and about these two cities. Examining documents produced by the World
      Bank's staff alongside the work of chroniclers residing in these cities provides an informed
      locale from which to analyze the World Bank's approach to issues confronting the urban spaces
      within Latin America. This project also argues that a common genre of the chronicle exists in
      these two cities, regardless of the language in which it is written. The first chapter
      contextualizes the project within a history of the World Bank and the genre of the chronicle
      in Mexico and Brazil. The second chapter focuses on Mexico, studying the chronicles of Elena
      Poniatowska and Carlos Monsiváis along side the work of the World Bank as they respond to the
      earthquake of 1985 in Mexico City. The third chapter considers urban poverty in Brazil's Rio
      de Janeiro and pulls from the writings of Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Luis Fernando Veríssimo,
      Affonso Romano de Sant'Anna, Marina Colasanti and Diogo Mainardi. The fourth chapter examines
      public transportation in Mexico City as well as the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, pulling from
      chronicles by Carlos Monsiváis and Diogo Mainardi. I argue that the World Bank must approach
      its lending decisions with a nuanced understanding of whom its loans and projects will affect.
      When designing projects with such cultural and social knowledge, the priorities addressed by
      World Bank align closely with the concerns forwarded by the chroniclers considered in this
      study. Moreover, this approach to project design and implementation enables the World Bank to
      honor its stated mission of "using [its] financial resources, staff and extensive
      experience to help developing countries reduce poverty, increase economic growth and improve
      their quality of life" (World Bank Group Brochure 3).</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Chiral Pt-dicationic catalysts capable of C-C bond formation with the intermediacy of
      carbocations were developed. Similar carbocations are key intermediates in the biosynthesis of
      terpenoid natural products, and are normally generated by protonation of an alkene or an
      epoxide under careful enzymatic guidance. Under non-enzymatic conditions such activations of
      alkenes are much more difficult to control. Synthetic Ptdicationic complexes were developed
      for selective generation of these key intermediates in two specific types of processes. One,
      the asymmetric Prins cyclization reaction, and second an asymmetric oxidative cation-olefin
      cascade cyclization reaction that converts polyolefin substrates into complex polycyclic
      products, an analogy to steroid biosynthesis. Highly electrophilic P2Pt2+ catalysts proved to
      be uniquely able to catalyze a Prins cyclization reaction in the reaction of alkenyl phenols
      and glyoxylate esters. Other chiral Lewis acids provided the products of a concerted
      glyoxylate-ene reaction. The uniqueness of the reactivity to Pt-dicationic catalysts suggested
      that they were able to access trappable ionic intermediates. This reaction was made highly
      enantioselective by employing (tol-BINAP)Pt2+ catalysts and tBu glyoxylate with various phenol
      substrates. The P2Pt2+ catalysts also proved capable of mediating regio- and
      diastereoselective oxidative polycyclization reactions of dienol and trienol susbtrates. This
      biomimetic cyclization is initiated by Pt(II) activation of a less substituted alkene at the
      terminus of a polyene susbtrate and is terminated by &lt;-hydride elimination. This
      transformation was rendered catalytic by employing trityl cation to abstract hydride from the
      putative cationic Pt-hydride to regenerate the Pt2+ catalyst. Good enantioselectivity could be
      achieved in this reaction by employing xylyl-PHANEHPOS as the bisphosphine ligand.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this dissertation, I explore how signs affect the body in German neoclassicism.
      This period constructs a particular body (the voluptuary's body) that derives primarily
      sensual-as opposed to cognitive-pleasure from the signs of art. Erotic literature with its
      sensual appeal, then, becomes a special case of art, one that manifests this relationship
      between signs and the body the most clearly. By focusing on erotic literature as a
      paradigmatic rather than a marginal case of literature, I am able to reconsider our current
      understanding of German neoclassicism. Erotic literature exceeds the aesthetic and semiotic
      principles that scholars have come to expect to circumscribe the literature of this period.
      Erotic literature moves beyond such categories as vividness, veracity, and verisimilitude to
      achieve an aesthetic pleasure of virtuality. Its arousing signs produce voluptuous sensations
      and transformations in the reader's body in addition to transmitting knowledge and
      manipulating affect. And as they strike-or stroke-the body, these signs appear less
      transparent than sticky. They do not recede before the ideas they signify, as they should do.
      Rather, they stick around; they remain in the foreground of the reader's consciousness,
      insistently calling attention to their own materiality rather than sublimating into spirit. I
      track this motion through Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's critical texts Rettungen des Horaz and
      his Laokoon essay; Christoph Martin Wieland's major fictional works from the mid-1760s, the
      Comische Erzählungen, Don Sylvio, and Geschichte des Agathon; and Gustav Schilling's novel Die
      Denkwürdigkeiten des Herrn von H. And as I show, these texts attempt to harness-that is, both
      exploit and contain-this unruly relationship between literature and the body for political and
      pedagogical projects.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>First isolated in 1984 from the marine sponge Forcepia trilabis, lasonolide A was
      found to inhibit A-549 human lung carcinoma cells and P-388 murine leukemia cell lines among
      others. This cytotoxic natural product was chosen because of its biological activity and
      challenging polyketide structure. Interesting structural features include two
      cis-2,6-substituted tetrahydropyran rings integrated into the highly unsaturated macrolide
      structure, and a quaternary stereogenic center at C22. Construction of the A-ring showcases a
      novel zinc triflate-mediated asymmetric alkynylzinc addition hetero-Michael reaction, which
      was developed to selectively form the 2,6-cis tetrahydropyran motif. To assemble the B-ring,
      alternate carbon nucleophiles were explored to displace the N-acyl thioimide auxiliary and
      prepare beta-ketonitrile and beta-ketoester moieties. Coupling of the three fragments via
      olefination, esterification, and metathesis strategies is also outlined.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Does the American mass public, broadly speaking, meet its normatively prescribed duty
      to monitor and react to changes in the political-economic world? Do specific segments of the
      mass public pose an obstacle to this \monitorial model" of political competence,
      which is itself central to democratic accountability? This study explores these questions with
      three separate studies. It will be shown that citizen learning and inference rest on two
      crucial factors: real-world information and psychological moti- vation. Taken together, the
      three studies demonstrate how the relative importance of information and motivation changes as
      a function of both individual characteristics, including cognitive capability and
      partisanship, and the contextual characteristics of the political environment, especially
      political campaigns. Attention is given to dif- ferential learning across several
      socioeconomic and political partisan classes to assess the breadth of understanding about
      politically consequential real-world change. It will turn out that, on the issues that affect
      policy and election outcomes, politically relevant information is often distributed fairly
      evenly across the mass public. The prototypi- cally ill-informed, which is to say, the people
      who have relatively low levels of education, income, and so forth, present a less serious
      obstacle to the monitorial model than do po- litical partisans, whose perceptions are affected
      by their motives to preserve consistency with their partisan attitudes and beliefs. However,
      even though these partisans' percep- tions are affected by such \motivated
      reasoning," their temporal-perception patterns reflect responsiveness to
      political-economic reality nonetheless. In broad perspective, this study demonstrates that
      knowledge of changing objective conditions, not static facts, is an instructive barometer for
      gauging citizen performance. Contrasted against conventional academic wisdom, the monitorial
      perspective produces markedly different, indeed more optimistic, conclusions about the
      political-information competency of the American mass public.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this ethnography, I focus on the community of reproductive medicine professionals
      in Argentina to examine how assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are transformed according
      to local conditions of practice, as well as how they are transformative of the societies they
      newly inhabit. Based on three continuous years of ethnographic, interview and archival
      research conducted primarily in Buenos Aires, my findings reveal that the production of ART in
      a given place is not a culturally-neutral process, but rather involves local forms of science,
      medicine, modernity, morality and choice. In chapter one, I give a contextual history of how
      ART began in Argentina, and locate today's Argentine infertility specialists within a
      transnational network of training, scientific prestige, innovation and competition. In chapter
      two, I examine the specificities of the local production of ART in Buenos Aires, which include
      a series of moral positions on family, motherhood, and the role of the Catholic Church in
      medical practice, as well as creative maneuverings around legal, economic and political
      constraints. In chapter three, I analyze the practice of gamete donation in Argentina, in
      which beliefs about genetic inheritance, options for family making, and the market-side of
      reproductive medicine all intersect. In chapter four, I focus on the problematic of the
      morally and legally ambiguous embryo, and examine two techniques in particular, embryo
      cryopreservation and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), to illustrate how medical and
      scientific protocols are translated to fit local conditions of practice. Throughout these
      chapters I argue that the production of these medical technologies are shifting deeply rooted
      beliefs about the sanctity of human life and the role of technology in manipulating that life.
      I conclude that currently in Argentina the reproductive medicine professionals who provide ART
      to the public are society's moral guardians, diagnosing the healthy body and family, defining
      when personhood begins, and dictating what protections are due human life. In the last
      instance, this cultural analysis is revealing not only of assisted reproduction practices in
      Argentina, but also circulates back to inform the production of ART as a global medical
      technology</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The Latino population is growing faster in the southeastern United States than
      anywhere else in the country and impacting communities on numerous fronts. This study sheds
      light on the complexity of how Latinos are represented in North Carolina's news media and
      ultimately deals with questions of belonging and of rights. The results show how societal
      forces work to marginalize groups, yet at the same time, that the marginalized have
      opportunities to counter the hegemonic discourses and practices. Specifically, this project
      examined newspaper coverage of Latinos in the Raleigh News &amp; Observer, the
      Winston-Salem Journal, La Conexión, and Qué Pasa. I used content analysis to examine five
      issues, then selected two, the changes to driver's license rules and the Mt. Olive boycott,
      for in-depth study using Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA). The content analysis found that
      coverage of the Mt. Olive boycott and changes to policies for issuing driver's licenses were
      the least covered issues despite being the most important regarding immigrant Latino rights.
      Additionally, the content analysis raised questions about what constitutes a
      "Latino" issue. The CDA of the driver's license changes revealed two
      overarching discourses that operated within a post-9/11 sociopolitical context:
      "us" vs. "them" and criminality. Constructing Latinos as
      "them" and attaching criminality justified taking away their access to
      resources, namely a driver's license. In the CDA of the Mt. Olive boycott, the Anglo and
      Latino newspapers used different discourses to talk about labor and economic justice for
      farmworkers. Anglo newspapers relied on the South's antiunion script to construct Mt. Olive as
      an innocent victim of a politically-motivated, northern labor union. In contrast, the Latino
      newspapers gave the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) a voice which they used to assert
      their struggle as a just and noble one - an example of the powerless fighting for what they
      rightly deserved. I conclude by mapping the issues onto a cultural citizenship continuum and
      propose that future research may define Latino issues based on this framework. In addition, I
      suggest that Latino newspapers find examples in which they have successfully articulated
      alternative discourses and model future struggles on these examples.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Relationship management is the practice of building strong relationships with
      important publics, including employees. It is expected that richer communication flowing
      between both employees and management will enhance feelings of trust between management and
      employees, ultimately resulting in stronger commitment to each other and to the organization.
      In addition, these feelings of trust and commitment will lead to a more positive reputation
      for the firm, as employees are happy to be employed by the organization and in turn, share
      their positive feelings with customers and other stakeholders. This relationship management
      effort is thought to build long-term relationships for the mutual benefit of an organization
      and its stakeholders. As employees have been thought to have more credibility with the public
      as representatives of the organization than corporate communications efforts, their opinions
      can influence other stakeholders to have a more positive opinion about the reputation of the
      firm. Internal communication describes this goal of communicating richly with employees to
      engage them in the priorities of the organization. Face-to-face communication was found to be
      the best method for building close relationships with employee publics. This study
      incorporates findings from employee interviews, executive interviews, as well as a large-scale
      survey of employees to better understand the role of rich communication in the context of
      relationship management with employees.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Over the past several decades, research has focused on utilizing ceramic materials in
      new technological applications. Their uses have been primarily in applications that involve
      high temperatures or corrosive environments. Unfortunately, ceramic materials have been
      limited especially since they can be brittle, failing in a sudden and catastrophic manner. A
      strong emphasis on understanding mechanical properties of ceramics and ways to improving their
      strength and toughness, has led to many new technologies. The present work is part of a larger
      research initiative that is aimed at using RF magnetron sputter deposition of
      yttria-stabilized zirconia to improve the fracture toughness of brittle substrates (more
      specifically dental ceramics). Partially-stabilized zirconia (PSZ) has been studied
      extensively, due to its high temperature stability and stress-induced tetragonal to monoclinic
      (T_M) martensitic phase transformation. RF magnetron sputtering was chosen as the deposition
      method because of its versatility, especially the ability to deposit oxides at low
      temperatures. Initial investigations focused on the development of
      process-structure-properties of YSZ sputtered deposited thin films. The YSZ thin films were
      deposited over a range of temperatures (22 - 300 C), pressures (5 - 25 mTorr), and gas
      compositions (Ar:O2 ratio). Initial studies characterized a select set of properties in
      relation to deposition parameters including: refractive index, structure, and film stress.
      X-ray Diffraction (XRD) showed that the films are comprised of mainly monoclinic and
      tetragonal crystal phases. The film refractive index determined by prism coupling, depends
      strongly on deposition conditions and ranged from 1.959 to 2.223. Wafer bow measurements
      indicate that the sputtered YSZ films can have initial stress ranging from 86 MPa tensile to
      192 MPa compressive, depending on the deposition parameters. Exposure to ambient conditions
      (25°C, 75 % relative humidity) led to large increase (~ 100 MPa) in the compressive stress of
      the films. Environmental aging suggests the change in compressive stress was related to water
      vapor absorption. These effects were then evaluated for films formed under different
      deposition parameters with varying density (calculated packing density) and crystal structure
      (XRD). Based on the above results, it was determined to evaluate stress as a function of
      substrate bias. It was shown that increasing substrate bias power disrupted columnar grain
      growth and reduced the percent change in compressive stress when exposed to ambient
      environments. TEM confirmed a reduction in inter-granular porosity for substrate bias
      depositions, but an increase in lateral defects. It was hypothesized that substrate bias would
      increase the film's density, but after inspection of SEM and TEM micrographs, it appeared that
      as bias was increased the density decreased. This T_M phase transformation has been well
      documented for bulk PSZ, but limited data exists for PSZ thin films. Data is presented that
      supports a stress-induced T=&gt;M transformation mechanism that occurs during
      sputter-deposition in the presence of a substrate bias. Substrate bias (0 - 50W) was
      originally applied to increase film density, modify microstructure, and vary film stress. The
      films were deposited using rf magnetron sputtering from a sintered yttria-stabilized zirconia
      (YSZ) target and subsequently characterized using scanning (SEM) and transmission electron
      microscopy (TEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and wafer bow measurement (for stress analysis).
      With no substrate bias the films exhibited a columnar grain structure consistent with
      sputterdeposited films, with a majority tetragonal phase as determined by XRD. Under higher
      substrate bias, wafer bow measurements indicated a steady increase in compressive stress as
      substrate bias increased (max. 310MPa at 50W bias), while XRD indicated a corresponding
      increase in the percentage of monoclinic phase. Both SEM and TEM analyses revealed a shift
      from a defect-free columnar structure to one consisting of lateral intra-columnar or
      trans-granular defects for films deposited under substrate bias conditions. It is believed
      that these defects form as a result of stress-relief in the growing film via the
      transformation from tetragonal to monoclinic phase due to bias-induced compressive stress. FEA
      modeling is used to confirm stress contours and defect generation within the films. The
      structure developed under substrate bias deposition is hypothesized to provide beneficial
      strengthening mechanisms, similar to microcrack toughening, when deposited on brittle
      substrates. This manuscript concludes with an analysis of YSZ thin films deposited on an
      alternative substrate (soda-lime glass) that replicates a bio-inert material.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The segmentation of brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) images, where the brain is
      partitioned into anatomical regions of interest, is a notoriously difficult problem when the
      underlying brain structures are influenced by pathology or are undergoing rapid development.
      This dissertation proposes a new automatic segmentation method for brain MRI that makes use of
      a model of a homogeneous population to detect anatomical deviations. The chosen population
      model is a brain atlas created by averaging a set of MR images and the corresponding
      segmentations. The segmentation method is an integration of robust parameter estimation
      techniques and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In clinical applications, the
      segmentation of brains with anatomical deviations from those commonly observed within a
      homogeneous population is of particular interest. One example is provided by brain tumors,
      since delineation of the tumor and of any surrounding edema is often critical for treatment
      planning. A second example is provided by the dynamic brain changes that occur in newborns,
      since study of these changes may generate insights into regional growth trajectories and
      maturation patterns. Brain tumor and edema can be considered as anatomical deviations from a
      healthy adult population, whereas the rapid growth of newborn brains can be considered as an
      anatomical deviation from a population of fully developed infant brains. A fundamental task
      associated with image segmentation is the validation of segmentation accuracy. In cases in
      which the brain deviates from standard anatomy, validation is often an ill-defined task since
      there is no knowledge of the ground truth (information about the actual structures observed
      through MRI). This dissertation presents a new method of simulating ground truth with
      pathology that facilitates objective validation of brain tumor segmentations. The simulation

      location, shape, and volume of the synthetic tumors are known with certainty, the simulated
      MRI can be used to objectively evaluate the accuracy of any brain tumor segmentation method.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>There is currently disagreement in the visual attention literature regarding the
      stimulus features capable of triggering a reflexive shift of attention. One theory posits that
      features activating the magnocellular (M) visual stream, such as abruptly appearing objects
      with luminance contrast and low spatial frequencies, are responsible for activating the
      reflexive attention system (e.g. Steinman et al., 1997; Yantis and Egeth, 1997). However,
      recent experiments suggest stimuli activating the parvocellular (P) stream, such as
      isoluminant colors with high spatial frequencies, may be equally important for initiating
      reflexive shifts of attention (e.g. Lu, 2006; Yeshurun, 2004). Using behavioral and
      eventrelated potential (ERP) measures, we designed stimuli to stimulate either the M or P
      system to test whether the predominate activation of these systems trigger similar reflexive
      attention mechanisms, or if mechanisms of attentional capture are engaged differently
      depending on M or P activation. We predicted that similar attention effects would be observed
      if both pathways triggered automatic attentional orienting. However, if only magnocellular
      activation engages the reflexive attention system then we hypothesized that attention effects
      would only be seen when stimuli activated this system and not the P system. The present
      findings support the view that both systems are capable of triggering reflexive visual
      orienting. Specifically, reaction times (RTs) to target stimuli were speeded and the P1 and
      P300 components enhanced when spatially preceded by both M and P cues at short interstimulus
      intervals (ISI's), but these findings were characteristically different at long ISIs where
      inhibition of return (IOR) typically occurs. Further evidence supporting attention capture
      from M and P activation was evidenced by a greater negativity to uncued compared to cued
      trials at short ISIs, i.e. the IIN component. However, we also found evidence that M and P
      stimulation produced different effects depending on whether the target stimulus activated the
      M or P system. Together these results are consistent with the basic processing characteristics
      of the M and P pathways and show that activation either pathway can trigger a reflexive shift
      of visual attention.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This research examines the impact of two potential antecedents of growth in
      high-technology, network industries. The first antecedent, installed base, is traditionally
      framed as a key driver of growth in these settings. The second, product quality, is thought to
      have only random influences on growth. This work tests the influence of both of these
      variables on growth in the packaged application software industry, and proposes that their
      relative influence may be contingent upon the network intensity of a given market or segment.
      In turn, installed base and timing of product release are proposed to have a significant
      impact on quality. The sample for this study encompassed five segments of the packaged
      application software industry from 1986-1998, including word processing, spreadsheets, desktop
      publishing, CAD, and personal finance. Several results from the empirical analysis offer
      useful insights into the nature of network industries, and implications for strategic
      management in these domains. First, installed base size exhibits a negative relationship with
      growth that becomes more positive as size increases. Second, product quality is positively and
      significantly associated with installed base growth. Third, the impact of size on growth is
      shown to vary across industry segments, suggesting that the influence of network effects may
      not be as homogeneous as extant theory implies. Finally, installed base is associated with
      higher baseline product quality within periods, consistent with the notion that a large
      installed base confers learning-based advantages to quality. Together, these findings indicate
      that competitive dynamics in network industries may be more complex than previously thought.
      This research extends existing theoretical and empirical work on network effects and positive
      feedback, and suggests new avenues for effective strategies in emerging high-technology
      settings.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study investigated the experience of isolation and loneliness in young adults
      with high-functioning autism. Thirty-seven high functioning autistic adults and 82 typically
      developing college freshmen were recruited through agencies serving individuals with autism
      and a local university. Participants completed measures assessing the presence of social
      relationships and feelings about those relationships, as well as overall mental health
      functioning. Results of the present study suggest that adults with high functioning autism are
      more isolated than their peers and that isolation from social networks and dyadic
      relationships leads to distress in this population. Interestingly, there were no group
      differences in the experience of distress associated with isolation. In addition, though
      adults with high functioning autism reported greater mental health difficulties than their
      peers, these difficulties were not directly associated with the experience of isolation.
      Limitations and clinical implications of the current study and directions for future work are
      discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Research has shown elevated mood, anxiety, and stress in mothers of children with
      developmental disabilities. These findings remain ambiguous due to inconsistencies in the
      definitions and groupings of maternal disorders, measurement instruments used, and inadequate
      samples. The behavioral overlap between these disorders permits examination of the association
      between the autistic and/or problem behavior of children and maternal mood, anxiety, and
      stress. This study examines the frequency and predictors of mood, anxiety, and stress in
      mothers of three groups: children with FXS, children with FXS/autism, and children with
      autism. Lifetime and current mood and anxiety disorders and current levels of stress were
      assessed in 56 mothers of children with the full mutation of FXS, 19 mothers of children with
      the full mutation of FXS and autism, and 38 mothers of children with autism. Mothers of
      children with autism reported increased rates of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) compared
      to mothers of children with FXS or FXS/autism. A greater proportion of mothers of children
      with autism reported experiencing two or more mood or anxiety disorders over their lifetime
      than mothers of children with FXS. Child problem behavior predicted maternal mood, anxiety,
      and stress across all groups. Autistic symptomatology of the child predicted maternal stress.
      In the majority of mothers, the initial onset of a reported mood or anxiety disorder was prior
      to the birth of the child, suggesting that childrearing burden cannot fully explain mood
      and/or anxiety in these mothers. The environmental and/or genetic contributions related to
      increased rates of GAD in mothers of children with autism compared to mothers of children with
      FXS should be examined further. Future studies should compare frequency of mood and anxiety in
      mothers of these groups to population estimates. Intervention and support services for mothers
      of children with FXS and autism should focus on reducing maternal stress by assisting them to
      manage the autistic and/or problem behavior of the child.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This research addresses three topics related to improving child welfare and mental
      health services for children involved with child welfare: need, identification, and
      servicesymptom relationships. Each study in this series uses data from the National Survey of
      Child and Adolescent Well-being (NSCAW), the first nationally-representative sample of
      children investigated for maltreatment. Results show that 62% of children experience
      clinical-level emotional-behavioral problems at some point over three years following a
      maltreatment investigation. One-fifth of children report clinical-level depression and 19%
      report clinical-level posttraumatic stress. Thought and attention problems are among the most
      prevalent and persistent types of problems reported by children's caregivers, as are
      externalizing behavior problems. Children appear to experience heightened symptoms at the time
      of the investigation, but also experience symptom discontinuity over time, suggesting the need
      for services that target multiple symptom-areas. At least 470,000 children nationally may not
      be recognized by child welfare workers as having mental health symptoms at the conclusion of a
      maltreatment investigation, according to this research. Using risk assessment and
      investigative information to identify children with symptoms correctly classifies 75 to 80% of
      children and therefore could serve as a first-level screen. This would reduce the number of
      children who are provided a standardized psychological measure, having the potential for
      benefit and cost-avoidance. Analysis of the relationship between mental health services and
      changes in children's symptoms over time failed to demonstrate a positive service-symptom
      relationship. That is, children who receive mental health services have significantly higher
      levels of symptoms compared with children who do not receive services. Children typically
      receive school-based counseling services and less often receive in-home counseling, suggesting
      the need for more family-focused approaches to their mental health. Children may receive
      services prompted by their "acting-out" behaviors, at the same time that
      their family is experiencing substantial problems. This may give children the message that
      their behavior is the primary problem rather than the family circumstances that led to their
      child welfare involvement. Clearly, maltreatment is associated with mental health problems,
      and our current state of knowledge and practice appears insufficient to make measurable
      differences in children's level of risk for such problems.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Two prospective randomized controlled studies of scientific curators of model organism
      databases (MODs) were conducted using common document collections to investigate the origins,
      nature, and extent of variation in curators' Gene Ontology (GO) annotations. Additional
      contextual data about curators' backgrounds, experience, personal annotation behaviors, and
      work practices were also collected to provide additional means of explaining variation. A
      corpus of nearly 4,000 new GO annotations covering 5 organisms was generated by 31 curators
      and analyzed at the paper, instance, and GO element levels. Variation was observed by organism
      expertise, by group assignment, and between individual and consensus annotations. Years of GO
      curation experience was found to not be a predictor of annotation instance quantities. Five
      facets of GO annotation quality (Consistency, Specificity, Completeness, Validity, and
      Reliability) were evaluated for utility, and showed promise for use in training novice
      curators. Pairwise matching and comparison of instances was found to be difficult and
      atypical, limiting the usefulness of the quality measures. Content analysis was performed on
      more than 600 pages of curators' hand-annotated paper journal articles used in GO annotation,
      yielding six types of common notations.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Jews have often been described as the moneylenders for medieval Europe and considered
      central in Europe's shift from a barter economy to a profit economy. By providing credit, the
      classic narrative holds, Jews performed a vital "economic function" when
      restrictions on "usury" prevented Christians from lending. This dissertation
      challenges that narrative historiographically and empirically. The classic narrative, I argue,
      was constructed in response to nineteenth-century debates over the emancipation of German
      Jewry (Chapter 2). It rests on two outdated theories developed by the German Historical
      School: a theory of economic stages and an organic model of folk development. Werner Sombart
      and Max Weber appropriated and transformed the narrative, and it persisted, against mounting
      evidence, in twentieth-century historiography. The scholarship on commercialization and the
      Commercial Revolution came to undercut the theoretical basis for the "economic
      function" ascribed to medieval Jewry. This literature in fact described
      commercialization without reference to Jews at all. But the implications for the narrative in
      Jewish history have not been drawn. I argue that empirical evidence shows that most Jews were
      not professional moneylenders (Chapter 3). In thirteenth-century England -- which purportedly
      provides the strongest case for the classic narrative -- most Jews belonged to an urban lower
      class, which scraped together a living from various occupations ranging from day laboring to
      huckstering and peddling. Jewish economic history, I argue, ought to envision Jews as
      Europeans undergoing commercialization together with Christians, rather than as an exterior,
      causal agent for commercialization. The commenda contracts of Jewish merchants from Marseille,
      involved in long-distance sea trade, suggest as much (Chapter 4). But even the literature on
      commercialization and the Commercial Revolution remains beholden to obsolete paradigms: It
      critiques the theory of economic stages but, in subscribing to the "rise of the money
      economy," remains rooted in it (Chapter 5). As a step toward rethinking the causal
      role attributed to money in the literature on the Commercial Revolution, I explore the meaning
      of money in the medieval mentalité (Chapter 6). Money, I argue, was not seen as a symbol of a
      new profit economy, but acted like a classic gift.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation, a survey of a random sample of 1,171 adults living in Maricopa
      County, Ariz., seeks insight into the changing relationship between news and geographically
      defined communities by focusing on two local news products, The Arizona Republic and
      azcentral.com. It is rooted in the widely held belief that there is a virtuous cycle linking
      print newspaper readership to sense of community in a manner that enhances social capital and
      attempts to determine the nature of this relationship in light of online media advancements
      including hyperlocal news and Web logs. To measure this community connection, this work draws
      together concepts from social identity theory and psychological sense of community research,
      suggesting empirical tools for measuring both geographical and online sense of community. With
      these measures, analysis focuses first on the nature of the news-community relationships and
      then compares them based on the media preferences of respondents. Results suggest that the
      Internet may not be as powerful a geographic community builder as the print product and that
      geographic community connections are stronger than those online regardless of respondents'
      usage habits. Based on these findings, directions for future scholarly research and actionable
      information for the newspaper industry are presented.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Ecologists recognize two components of biodiversity: inventory diversity, the species
      composition of a single place, and differentiation diversity, more commonly called
      beta-diversity, which is derived by several different methods from the change in species
      composition between places. Beta-diversity is determined through a complex array of processes
      relating to the interaction of species traits and characteristics of the physical landscape
      over time. Geographic variation in betadiversity reflects past and present differences in
      environment, ecological interactions, and biogeographic history, including barriers to
      dispersal. As beta-diversity quantifies the turnover in species across space, it has important
      applications to the scaling of diversity, the delineation of biotic regions and conservation
      planning. Despite the importance of beta-diversity, relatively little is known about
      diversity's "other component", particularly at broad scales. In this
      dissertation, I trace the conceptual evolution of beta-diversity in order to reconcile the
      different views surrounding it, and examine empirical patterns of terrestrial vertebrate
      beta-diversity at broad spatial scales in order to gain insight into this important diversity
      component. I use range data for amphibians, birds, and mammals within the Western Hemisphere
      to produce the only maps to date of beta-diversity at this scale for multiple classes of
      terrestrial vertebrates and test for cross-taxon congruence in broad-scale beta-diversity. I
      also examine the strength and geographic variation of the relationship between beta-diversity
      and species richness. In a third empirical chapter, I analyze whether beta-diversity of
      amphibians at a global scale varies systematically across biogeographic realms and biomes. My
      results show that vertebrates classes have congruent patterns of beta-diversity across the
      Western Hemisphere. Further, beta-diversity and richness exhibit disparate patterns for these
      taxa. I demonstrate, however, that the strength of beta-diversity congruence and the
      relationship of betadiversity to species richness vary with spatial extent, geographic
      location, and between taxa. Amphibian beta-diversity at a global scale also shows complex
      variation across biogeographic realms and biomes. These findings illustrate the influence of
      environmental, historical, and taxonomic differences on ecological relationships, and stress
      the need for stringent tests across multiple taxa and regions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Assembly of most ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) proceeds via multi-step structural
      reorganization in both protein and RNA components. To date, essentially all assembly models
      for RNP have tacitly assumed that structural interaction between any two given components
      during an RNP formation either facilitates later steps in the assembly or has no effect on
      continued assembly. In contrast to this implicit hypothesis, this work reveals that untimely
      interaction between components may, in fact, disrupt native formation of an RNP. In the
      assembly of the mammalian signal recognition particle (SRP), SRP54 interacts with the
      preformed SRP19-SRP RNA complex to form the native SRP ternary complex. In contrast, if SRP54
      interacts with the RNA prior to formation of the native SRP19-SRP RNA complex, these three
      components interact to form an alternate ternary complex. In this complex, two extended loops
      in SRP19 cannot natively interact with the RNA. It has been shown that the premature RNA
      binding by SRP54 alters the SRP19- RNA assembly energy landscape in such a way that an
      alternate SRP19-RNA folding pathway leading to non-native complex formation becomes
      kinetically prevalent. In a different instance, it has been found that prior RNA binding by
      SRP68/72 negatively affects assembly of SRP19 with the SRP RNA, and vice versa. Experimental
      results support a model in which structural tension between two similar but slightly distinct
      RNA structures induced by SRP19 and SRP68/72 binding is the origin of such anticooperativity.
      Overall, this work suggests that the order by which each constituent in an RNP interacts with
      others during assembly may have a decisive role in formation of the native complex. It has
      been inferred in this work that idiosyncratic assembly mechanisms, such as cellular
      compartmentalization and preferred early and late assembly phases, may play critical
      regulatory roles in preventing order-of-interaction driven misassembly for many
      multi-component RNPs in the cell.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>According to ancient sources, Falerii Novi was founded by Rome in 241 BC following the
      unsuccessful revolt of the older Faliscan centre, Falerii Veteres. The circumstances of this
      encounter and the status of the new city have been questioned in recent years. Nevertheless,
      Falerii Novi emerged at the peak of pre-Augustan Roman expansion, a period which began
      following the dissolution of the Latin League in 338. Excavation at the site is longstanding,
      but also sporadic and poorly documented. The most important investigation in recent years was
      the geophysical survey of the walled area undertaken in the late 1990s as part of the Tiber
      Valley Project. The result of this undertaking is a detailed and complete city plan
      illuminating many of the Falerii Novi's key architectural features including the forum,
      theatre, baths, and elite houses without the need of excavation. In 2004, Professor Nicola
      Terrenato and I initiated the Falerii Novi Project as an offshoot of this endeavour. For the
      last three seasons, our team has engaged in an architectural survey of the city walls that
      surround the site in an attempt to better understand their role in the city's larger urban
      scheme. This dissertation attempts to reconstruct the urban horizon of Falerii Novi, drawing
      upon the full corpus of available data from the earliest excavations in the nineteenth century
      to the most recent surveys. In doing so, it identifies and clarifies a number of ambiguities
      within the geophysical plan. Second, it considers the role played by the city in the urban
      evolution that was ongoing throughout the peninsula during the mid-Republic. Finally, it seeks
      to better understand the political and martial circumstances surrounding the foundation of the
      city and its official standing in the newly organised Latium adjectum. This final discussion
      reconsiders the relationship between Rome and the local communities of Italy as well as the
      very nature of Romanisation itself, at least within the region of the ancient Faliscans.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Using data from the Context of Adolescent Substance Use, the current study
      investigated and compared how the peer contexts of Black and White youth influence adolescent
      drinking behavior, while considering the moderating influences of family and school contexts.
      Primary socialization theory guided the research which suggests that the peer context is
      primary in the transmission of pro-social and deviant norms for the adolescent, but that peer
      influences can be moderated by family and school influences. The two most important contextual
      influences identified by the theory are behavioral norms and the strength of the bonds with
      others in the context. A specific study aim was to investigate whether the effects of
      adolescent alcohol use on alcohol use by peers, mother, and schoolmates were moderated by the
      adolescent's attachment to peers, mother, and school, respectively. In addition, the study
      examined whether the effects of peer alcohol use on adolescent alcohol use were moderated by
      alcohol use by mother and schoolmates and by the adolescent's attachment to mother and school.
      Relationships were examined for both any recent alcohol and heavy alcohol use, and separate
      analyses were conducted for Black and White youth. Consistent with prior studies of adolescent
      alcohol behavior, findings supported some differences between Black and White youth in
      predictors of alcohol use. Moreoever, aligned with the theoretical framework, the study
      results show the behavior of the peer context - peer alcohol use - to be the most salient
      predictor for adolescent alcohol behaviors. Other relationships suggested by the theoretical
      framework supported were for the mother context such that attachment to the mother attenuated
      the influence of mother's alcohol use on recent alcohol use for both Black and White youth and
      on recent heavy alcohol use for White youth only. For the school context, counterintuitive
      findings resulted. Therefore, results show the strength of attachment to and reported alcohol
      use of other adolescent social contexts are important in transmitting pro-social or deviant
      norms. However, a richer understanding of how social contexts transmitt norms for Black and
      White youth warrants further investigation using Primary Socialization Theory.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Motion capture, or mocap, is a prevalent technique for capturing and analyzing hu- man
      articulations. Nowadays, mocap data are becoming one of the primary sources of realistic human
      motions for computer animation as well as education, training, sports medicine, video games,
      and special effects in movies. As more and more applications rely on high-quality mocap data
      and huge amounts of mocap data become available, there are imperative needs for more effective
      and robust motion capture techniques, bet- ter ways of organizing motion databases, as well as
      more efficient methods to compress motion sequences. I propose a data-driven, segment-based,
      piecewise linear modeling approach to ex- ploit the redundancy and local linearity exhibited
      by human motions and describe human motions with a small number of parameters. This approach
      models human mo- tions with a collection of low-dimensional local linear models. I first
      segment motion sequences into subsequences, i.e. motion segments, of simple behaviors. Motion
      seg- ments of similar behaviors are then grouped together and modeled with a unique local
      linear model. I demonstrate this approach's utility in four challenging driving prob- lems:
      estimating human motions from a reduced marker set; missing marker estimation; motion
      retrieval; and motion compression.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This research undertakes a specific-factors analysis of trade politics in a world of
      crossborder capital mobility and finds that inter-sectoral goods market relationships, as well
      as labor mobility, do influence the patterns of industry lobbying for trade protection when
      foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into the US. I study inter-sectoral goods markets by
      exploiting input-output tables on the structure of the American economy prepared periodically
      by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the U.S. Commerce Department. I show that sales or
      purchase dependencies affect a sector's lobbying for trade protection when
      "neighboring" sectors receive FDI. I also show that the level of
      inter-sectoral labor mobility affects industry lobbying because FDI-receiving sectors usually
      pull labor from other sectors. Industry lobbying for trade protection is measured by (1)
      financial contributions to the political campaigns of members of Congress who vote for a
      protectionist bill; and (2) petitions filed with the US International Trade Commission (USITC)
      requesting antidumping or countervailing duties during the five Congressional periods (1981 -
      1990).</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study presents data from an ethnography focused on college-ready, Mexicanorigin
      undocumented high school students and the teacher allies in the public school system that
      assisted in these students' attempts to access higher education. Through a Critical Race
      Theory and Latino Critical Theory framework, this research examined the structural limitations
      of continuing on to higher education created by the policies that currently exist in North
      Carolina, findings that policies in North Carolina make it difficult, if not financially
      impossible, for nearly every undocumented student in this study to access college. The data
      demonstrate that, despite the resiliency and academic achievements of the undocumented
      students in the K-12 system, legal constraints prohibited undocumented students from pursuing
      any realistic post-secondary options. The state is losing out on an opportunity to capitalize
      on the transnational capital undocumented students possess from their experiences in two
      cultures. Particular attention in the study was paid to how these undocumented college-ready
      students positioned themselves at school, and how the public discourse attempted to position
      them with labels such as "illegal" and "problem". The
      students' lives provide powerful counternarratives to challenge the deficit perspectives about
      the contribution undocumented students make to the state of North Carolina.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Implicit memory is memory for information that is not driven by conscious processing.
      This study investigated the role of attention during implicit memory retrieval across four
      experiments using a test-phase division of attention. Implicit retrieval is dissociable into
      perceptual and conceptual forms. Implicit retrieval is further dissociable into tests that
      involve stimulus identification or stimulus production. Several lines of research make
      predictions about implicit retrieval in general, and with respect to these two dissociations.
      The present study used four implicit tests that can be classified according to each of these
      two dimensions. Experiment 1 used a perceptual identification test; Experiment 2 used a
      word-stem completion test; Experiment 3 used a category exemplar production test; and
      Experiment 4 used a category verification test. Attention was divided during the test-phase
      only with one of several secondary tasks. It was found that, across all experiments, none of
      the secondary tasks reduced levels of priming for any of the implicit tests. Further, implicit
      retrieval had no detrimental effects on performance for any of the secondary tasks. All of the
      above support the idea that implicit retrieval is automatic.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The population of children in early childhood settings is becoming increasingly
      culturally and linguistically diverse, and these changes in demographics have warranted
      teachers becoming more culturally responsive and better prepared to work with diverse young
      children and families. Teacher preparation programs across the nation have responded
      differently to this critical issue because of the different contexts in which they are in.
      Some promising strategies are including cultural and linguistic diversity in both course
      content and clinical experiences into early childhood teacher preparation programs. Using data
      from the National Prekindergarten Center's (NPC) National Study of Early Childhood Teacher
      Preparation Programs and the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) Integrated
      Post-Secondary Education Dataset (IPEDS), this research study examined the variables that
      contributed to how much cultural and linguistic diversity content and experiences were
      required of Bachelor's degree students in their coursework and practica in early childhood
      teacher preparation programs. Specifically, geographical contexts, program and institutional
      characteristics were analyzed from a sample of 417 Bachelor's degree programs to determine how
      these variables predicted the amount of diversity content and experience required in teacher
      preparation programs. Results indicated that percentage of non-Hispanic White in a state,
      geographic region, degree of urbanization, governance of institutions, NCATE accreditation,
      and the presence of non-White full-time faculty in early childhood programs were predictors of
      coursework or practica requirements. Implications and recommendations for policy, future
      research, and early childhood teacher preparation are discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Since much surface ocean data is Lagrangian in nature, its assimilation into ocean
      models is a key element of an ocean forecasting system. We investigate the propaga- tion of
      information vertically caused by the existing vertical correlations between a stack of layers
      in the water column, such as the Eulerian velocity field and other dy- namical variables, by
      observing Lagrangian data in the surface. We test the method by using different layered models
      with the known Lagrangian observations at dis- crete time intervals in the surface layer and
      unknown sub-surface layers. We adopt the method for assimilating Lagrangian data in which the
      model is augmented with drifter advection equations and track the correlations between the
      flow and the drifters via the Kalman Filter. The experiments show that Lagrangian data
      assimilation is feasible and effective for layered models. The technique is first tested on a
      two layer point vortex flow: a two layer point vortex system of (N(1) v ;N(2) v ) vortices at
      each layer with a Gaussian white noise term is modeled by its deterministic counterpart.
      Positions of N(1) d drifter particles in the top layer are observed at regular time intervals
      and assimilated into the model. Numeri- cal experiments demonstrate successful system tracking
      for (N(1) v ;N(2) v ;N(1) d ;N(2) d ) = (2; 2; 1; 0). Our numerical model simulations show
      that our method is capable of suc- cessful tracking of the vortices in both of the layers by
      observing the Lagrangian data from the top layer. It demonstrates that we can capture the
      Eulerian velocity field of the point vortex flow in the sub-surface layer by assimilating the
      Lagrangian data in the top layer. The method we have developed gives an understanding of the
      potential of Lagrangian data assimilation in models with vertical variation. We further test
      the method on the two and a half layer reduced gravity shallow water double gyre unsteady flow
      configuration. Our numerical simulations show that the method is capable of correcting both of
      the active layers even if Lagrangian ob- servations are only available in the top active layer
      and the assimilation time interval is of the order of the Lagrangian auto-correction time
      scale of the flow. The results clearly demonstrate that our method is effective when dealing
      with a more complex dynamics flow with an unknown sub-surface flow structure. The Lagrangian
      data assimilation method that we have developed, therefore, provides an approach that allows
      us to fully realize the potential of Lagrangian data for assimilation in more realistic ocean
      models.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this dissertation, molecular dynamics simulations were performed for systems
      containing amphiphilic aggregates, such as monolayers, bilayers, and reverse micelles. Various
      analysis methods were used in order to investigate structural and dynamical properties and
      solve particular problems for different systems. First, we present simulations where we
      observed successful self-assembly of reverse micelles in a three-component system containing
      supercritical CO2, water, and fluorinated surfactant starting from random configurations. Such
      self-assembly allows for the future computational study of structural and thermodynamic
      properties of microemulsions in water/CO2 systems that will be less dependent on the initial
      conditions. Next, a series of molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the PFPE
      (perfluoropolyether) and PE (polyether) surfactant monolayers and micelles at the
      water/supercritical carbon dioxide interface. We observed that values of intramolecular bonded
      interaction parameters which are related to chain rigidity determine the monolayer surface
      pressure. We show that good and bad properties of PFPE/PE surfactants are connected to
      conformational entropy. In order to study the effect of the hydration force, we simulated
      systems with model hydrophilic plates. We studied the effect of charge correlation on the
      potential of mean force between plates. The orientational structure of water between the
      plates was investigated to understand the effect of molecular structure of water on the
      properties of the potential of mean force. Finally, we calculated the free energy cost for
      removing a cholesterol molecule from two different lipid bilayers. The results can help us to
      understand the relationship between the lipid structure and the lipid-cholesterol affinity.
      N-palmitoyl-sphingomyelin was found to have a better cholesterol affinity compared with that
      of phosphatidylcholine lipid DPPC, according to our free energy values from molecular dynamics
      simulations.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation focuses on investigations into the reactivity and regioselectivity
      of hydrocarbon C-H bond activation by Tp[prime]Pt(IV) (Tp [prime] = hydridotris(3,5-
      dimethylpyrazolyl)borate) reagents via (1) thermolysis, (2) Lewis acid addition, and (3) low
      temperature protonation reactions. Insertion of alpha-olefins into a Pt-H or Pt-Ph bond has
      been found to occur. The synthetic and mechanistic investigations of these insertion reactions
      provide a starting point toward the aim of hydrocarbon functionalization.--Partial abstract.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The percentage of graduate degrees awarded to African American, Hispanic, and Native
      American students, as a group, remains low. Undergraduate research programs are one strategy
      currently implemented to increase underrepresented students'participation in graduate
      education. Results of several research and evaluation studies indicate that the programs are
      effective in enhancing participants' perceptions of and interests in graduate study, but there
      is a lack of understanding concerning how or why the programs are effective. The current study
      employed structural equation modeling techniques to develop and test a model to investigate
      the relationships among program outcomes and underrepresented students' plans to pursue
      graduate study. Data for the study were taken from surveys administered to students in the
      1988-2006 cohorts of one summer research program, resulting in a sample of just over 600
      students. Results indicated that the model had good fit to the data with the initial data set,
      chi squared (14, N= 319) = 17.47, p = .23, CFI = 1.00, TLI =1.00, RMSEA = .03, and SRMR = .04
      and with the cross-validation data set, chi squared (15, N= 317) = 19.78, p = .18, CFI = 1.0,
      TLI= 1.0, RMSEA= .03 and SRMR= .04. More specifically, in the cross-validation procedure,
      seven of the eight paths tested were significant at p &lt; .05, indicating support for the
      hypothesized relationships among faculty preceptor relationship, program satisfaction,
      increased knowledge of graduate school and research, outcome value of program participation,
      increased interest in graduate school, and plans for graduate study. The amount of variance
      explained by the model was, 24% in sample one and 22% in sample two. The findings have
      implications for program design, program replication, program improvement, and evaluation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation aims to deepen our understanding of free word order phenomena or
      "scrambling." It offers a unified approach to some fundamental limitations
      on scrambling both in clauses and in noun phrases of Korean. These would have been attributed
      to a headedness parameter in earlier syntactic theories but are problematic in more recent
      syntactic theories in the minimalist framework where such a parameter cannot be naturally
      stated. Korean scrambling has several limitations. It is blocked from preposing the verb. It
      does not commute noun phrases that bear the same Case, nor does it prepose the right member of
      a small clause. I argue that these descriptive generalizations follow from a single, elegant
      restriction: only semantically complete or 'saturated' constituents can scramble. My
      contention is that this restriction is part of Universal Grammar and should be an organizing
      principle of all natural languages. The universality of the restriction is challenged by
      scrambling phenomena in Turkish which have different properties than their Korean
      counterparts. This variation is explained by recognizing two types of scrambling distinguished
      by their landing site.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The central focus of this project is on the new social network conceptualizations of
      international system structure and national power. This project examines two traditional
      questions using the social network conceptualizations: (1) how do we conceive a state's
      national power, and (2) how does the distribution of national powers define international
      system structure? The project also answers the following question by applying the above
      questions to the empirical phenomena of international relations: how does redefining
      "power" and "system" in this way contribute to a better
      understanding of international politics? This project argues that international system
      structure is more accurately depicted by considering different interaction networks
      participated in by all system members, and that a state's power is more accurately
      conceptualized by considering how it interacts with all other states in the international
      system of different networks. The social network conception of national power, derived from
      the social network conception of international system structure, is applied to two empirical
      phenomena, focusing on their power explanations. The empirical analyses of militarized
      conflicts find that: (1) at the system level, the results do not reveal any clear support for
      either of power theories, but (2) at the dyadic level, the results strongly support power
      preponderance theory over balance of power theory. The analyses of economic sanctions find
      that sanction cases with disproportional network power balance between sender and target are
      far less likely to be successful, while cases with the target possessing high network power
      are far more likely to be successful. The evidence from nonparametric model discrimination
      statistics and information criteria measures shows that the conflict and sanctions models with
      new structural network power measures have greater explanatory power than or statistically
      outperform those with old attributional power measures, such as COW index and GNP. Finally,
      this project provides graphical representations of international system structure and national
      power to show how network conceptions give a radically different view of international
      relations than the older scalar representations do. The graphical representations of
      international conflict and sanction networks also reveal that the significant majority of
      conflicts and sanctions are indeed regional, "connected," and
      "recurrent."</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In metazoans the replication dependent histones are produced during S-phase of the
      cell cycle. The timely production of histones during S-phase is required to quickly package
      the newly synthesized DNA. Much of this S-phase regulation is achieved by the regulation of
      histone pre-mRNA processing. Histone mRNAs are the only mRNAs in metazoans that do not end in
      a poly(A) tail instead ending in a conserved 26 nucleotide sequence that forms a stem loop. A
      protein called Stem Loop Binding Protein (SLBP) binds to the stem loop which along with the U7
      snRNP recruits an endonuclease complex to cleave the histone pre-mRNA to create the mature
      histone transcript. Drosophila contains a single SLBP gene, which is required for histone
      pre-mRNA processing during embryogenesis, the larval stages of development, and during
      oogenesis. In the absence of SLBP, histone mRNAs become polyadenylated by the use of cryptic
      polyadenylation sites downstream of the normal cleavage site. These polyadenylated transcripts
      perdure outside of S-phase in cells that are undergoing endocycles. In addition to Drosophila
      SLBP's role in histone pre-mRNA processing, a 53 amino acid region of the N-terminus is
      required for viability of the organism but is dispensable for histone mRNA processing
      indicating a second function for SLBP in histone metabolism. At the end of S-phase histone
      mRNAs are rapidly destroyed. The human protein 3'hExo has been implicated in the degradation
      of histone mRNAs. Drosophila contains a single potential homologue of 3'hExo, Snipper, which
      is capable of degrading and binding to histone mRNAs in vitro. However, in Snipper mutant
      flies no defect in histone mRNA degradation was seen, indicating that Snipper is not required
      for the regulated destruction of histone mRNAs and has a yet to be discovered function.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study utilizes a unique data set containing detailed labor market information for
      individuals employed by the state of North Carolina over ten years. The inclusion of the
      state's promotion decisions and each worker's annual performance evaluations allow for an
      empirical test of the presence of statistical discrimination that has not been possible in
      previous studies. Statistical discrimination is said to exist if, in the absence of perfect
      information about a worker's productivity, an employer uses characteristics of that worker's
      (race or gender) group to substitute for individual-specific information missing from a signal
      of the worker's productivity. If the signal is noisier for blacks or women than it is for
      white men, equally productive workers may be paid differently. If, however, performance
      evaluation serves as a suitable proxy for individual productivity and if statistical
      discrimination exists at the point of hiring, then the significance of observable
      characteristics (race and gender) in explaining wage or promotion disparities should diminish
      with tenure. Results suggest that blacks may be statistically discriminated against at the
      time of hire, but that men and women are not treated differently. This outcome elicits further
      investigation into how statistical discrimination affects other labor market outcomes which
      differ across groups, including wage disparities and the rate at which promotions are
      realized. Equations explaining the dynamic employment process approximated by the wage and
      salary grade, performance evaluation, promotion, and quit probabilities of North Carolina
      state employees are estimated jointly to allow for correlation in unobserved permanent and
      time- varying heterogeneity factors affecting each outcome. When controlling for measures
      unique to these data, such as performance evaluation and promotion history, women and black
      men are not shown to be significantly more or less likely to be promoted than white men. After
      controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, endogeneity of relevant explanatory variables, and
      performance and promotion history, wage gaps effectively disappear. Consistent with the result
      that statistical discrimination may exist at the time of hire, tenure interacted with race
      and/or gender produces negligible or insignificant coefficients in all equations, suggesting
      that after controlling for performance, race and gender do not independently influence
      employment outcomes.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Planned organizational changes can be expensive and difficult to implement. Research
      suggests that implementation failure occurs when managers do not gain their employees'
      skilled, consistent, and committed program (or product) use (Klein, Conn, &amp; Sorra,
      2001). This definition highlights the need to understand commitment to change and the
      implementation stage of organizational change. The purpose of this dissertation is to
      investigate attitudinal and behavioral responses to an organizational change by specifying how
      employee-generated reasons, and dyadic influence mechanisms, relate to employee commitment to
      change. Two theories are used to understand the processes employees go through in deciding to
      support and implement a change. First, Behavioral Reasons Theory (Westaby, 2002, 2005)
      identifies the reasons people consider when deciding to support or resist a change-and I
      extend this theory by suggesting that reasons may have organizing categories. Second, I build
      upon social information processing theory (Salancik &amp; Pfeffer, 1978) to suggest that
      people emphasize different reasons for and against supporting a change after interacting with
      different network partners. I then argue that employee commitment to change is in part due to
      the reasons employees adopt from influential network partners at work. I close by further
      validating that certain types of commitment to change (affective, normative, and continuance)
      relate to certain implementation behaviors. Findings indicated and that employee ratings of
      reasons were subject to influence effects over time (even controlling for original ratings).
      This was true in the case of reasons related to resource issues and reasons related to the
      opinions of others. Findings also indicate a significant effect for relationship symmetry and
      the closeness of reason ratings over time, again for two types of reasons. Also, there was
      evidence that reasons may be organized by categories, and that certain categories relate to
      different types of commitment to change. Lastly, regression results indicated that two of the
      three types of commitment to change related to behavioral outcomes, specifically cooperation
      and championing behaviors. This work helps researchers understand more about the
      social-contextual factors related to organizational change and it can help practitioners
      intervene in facilitating the implementation of organizational change initiatives.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The spatial distributions of dissolved in situ methane concentrations and
      biogeochemical processes were investigated in cold seep sediments containing gas hydrates and
      brine fluids along the northern continental slope of the Gulf of Mexico and the Northern
      Cascadia Margin, offshore Vancouver Island. The measured distributions elucidate the role of
      biogeochemical processes in controlling hydrate stability and provide evidence for a
      potentially large source of methane directly from brine seeps. To obtain in situ methane
      concentrations, two novel pore-fluid samplers were developed and tested. While both samplers
      retained gas samples at in situ pressures, HYDRA used active suction to collect discreet
      samples while the Pore-Fluid Array used pumps driven by osmosis to slowly collect a temporal
      record of pore-fluid chemical composition. Within hydrate-bearing sediments, the successful
      retrieval of 14 in situ methane concentration profiles with HYDRA showed that from immediately
      adjacent to and as far as 350 cm away from outcropping hydrate, porefluids contained less than
      15 mM dissolved methane, a factor of four lower than methane saturated fluids. While
      undersaturated conditions are expected near the sediment-water interface, these results
      suggest that hydrates in the shallow sediments are not thermodynamically stable and could be
      dissolving. However, the observed hydrates may be more stable than theory predicts if their
      dissolution is kinetically controlled by impurities concentrated on their surfaces. Hydrate
      stability was not strongly affected by biogeochemical processes occurring adjacent to hydrate.
      Spatial variability in rates of sulfate reduction and anaerobic methane oxidation were largely
      controlled by the availability of petroleum and/or chemosynthetically derived carbon, rather
      than by distance from hydrate deposits. In brine filled sediments, in situ dissolved methane
      concentrations reached 25 mM and steep chloride concentration gradients could be explained by
      upward advection rates that varied between 3 and 65 cm/year. As there was no indication of
      methane oxidation in these brine sediments, these sites may be an important direct source of
      methane to the oceans. The combined results of this study demonstrate the importance of in
      situ quantification of methane concentrations and biogeochemical processes within hydrate and
      brine sediments.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The unifying theme in both chapters of my dissertation is the dynamic intertemporal
      investment and consumption decision making of utility maximizing economic agents. In the first
      chapter, I solve a general equilibrium model where the agents suspect model mis-specification
      in characterization of the probability distributions of risky asset returns. The agents solve
      the consumption-investment optimization problem with the possibility of model
      mis-specification in mind. I model agents' optimization process using Cox and Huang martingale
      approach. This is followed by a calibration study of the theoretical results using US and
      Japan equity investment flows data. The goal is to assess model adequacy and to study how much
      uncertainty is required to explain the observed home bias of US and Japanese investors. In the
      second chapter I solve a partial equilibrium model where the agent faces multi-factor and
      non-linear stochastic volatility in risky asset returns processes. This task is done by
      solving the stochastic dynamic Hamilton, Jacobi, Bellman equation associated with the
      discounted expected lifetime utility of the agent following the approach of Kushner and
      Dupuis. I study numerical solutions to this problem.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The manner in which sentence processing mechanisms interact with other cognitive
      processes was investigated by examining the interaction between the syntactic complexity of a
      sentence and the difficulty of reasoning about the information in the sentence. In the
      experiments, participants were presented with a sentence containing a relative clause (RC).
      Syntactic complexity factors (type of extraction for all four experiments, type of modified
      head for the first experiment) and complexity of reasoning factors (determinacy of the
      implicit relation present in a complex verb for Experiments 1- 4 and the nature of the
      relation between verbs in a complex sentence for Experiments 2- 4) were varied. Together the
      results of the four experiments show that reasoning occurs after basic processes of sentence
      interpretation and that those processes are not influenced by the cognitive demands of
      reasoning. These results provide evidence against the idea that sentence processing shares
      resources with more general processes (e.g. Just &amp; Carpenter, 1992) and provide
      support for the idea that the resources used for sentence processing are separate from those
      used for consciously controlled processes (Waters &amp; Caplan, 1996).</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a ring of myosin II forms in a
      septindependent manner at the presumptive budding site in late G1. This ring remains at the
      bud neck until the onset of cytokinesis, when actin is recruited to it and the resulting
      actomyosin ring contracts. Concurrently, a septum of cell wall (including a chitinous primary
      septum synthesized by Chs2p) is formed to complete cytokinesis. Mutants lacking MYO1 (the only
      myosin II gene) have varyingly severe phenotypes that can be suppressed either by deletion of
      a nonessential subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) or by
      overexpression of IQG1 or CYK3. Iqg1p is the only S. cerevisiae IQGAP and is required for both
      actomyosin-ring formation and primary-septum formation, and hence for normal cytokinesis.
      Because the actomyosin ring itself is not essential for primary-septum formation, Iqg1p must
      have another cytokinetic function(s), which may involve stimulating Cyk3p (a septin-dependent
      protein involved in cytokinesis) and Hof1p (a possible linker between the actomyosin ring and
      the primary-septum-synthesis machinery) to function in a septin-dependent,
      actomyosin-ring-independent pathway. Subsequent analyses showed that Iqg1p is increased in
      abundance and persists after cytokinesis in APC/C mutants, that Iqg1p is ubiquitinated
      directly by APC/C in vitro, and that a nondegradable Iqg1p (missing a novel recognition motif)
      can suppress myo1[delta] phenotypes. These data suggest that Iqg1p is a direct target of the
      APC/C. To identify additional proteins involved in septin-dependent,
      actomyosin-ring-independent cytokinesis, dosage-suppressor screens have been conducted, using
      myo1[delta] cyk3[delta] and myo1[delta] hof1[delta] synthetic-sick mutants. Some of the genes
      identified include EGT2 (encoding a cell-wall endoglucanase), ECM33 (encoding a GPI-anchored
      protein that may regulate cell-wall organization), and a truncated CDC24 (encoding the GEF for
      the Rho-type GTPase Cdc42p) that lacks the C-terminal PB1 domain. Overexpressing Ecm33p or the
      truncated Cdc24p can also suppress the iqg1[delta] and chs2 delta growth defects and restore
      primary-septum formation in iqg1[delta] cells. Furthermore, the suppression by truncated
      Cdc24p appears to be Cdc42p-independent and may involve another Rho-type GTPase(s). Finally,
      the dosage-suppressor screen also uncovered a gene, YJL055W, that when overexpressed directly
      suppresses the inviability of URA3+ cells in the presence of 5- fluoroorotic acid.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this dissertation I report the structure and property characterization of two kinds
      of materials on the micro- and nano-scale level, the self-healing polymer Surlyn and a
      titanate nanotube/organic molecule hybrid. Multiple techniques have been utilized to study the
      structural, dynamic, thermal, and optical properties of the materials. In the first study, the
      thermal, structural, and dynamic properties of the self-healing polymer Surlyn
      (poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid) polymer neutralized with Na+) were investigated. By
      introducing a suitable cation, Na+ e.g., Surlyn possesses unique properties, such as the
      intriguing property of self-healing. Understanding the role of the cations in the material,
      the chemical structure and the physical properties of the polymer is crucial for potential
      applications. The thermal property of Surlyn is characterized by differential scanning
      calorimetry (DSC) and microscopic structures are studied by NMR. It is found that although
      thermal properties change significantly, the structure and dynamics of ionic aggregates
      (consisting of Na+-O- pairs) remain unchanged under aging and mechanical deformation. The
      distance between Na+ ions was also estimated. In the second study titanate nanotubes were
      successfully synthesized. Titanate nanotubes have great potential for applications in
      photocatalysis due to their unique structural and photocatalytic properties. However, their
      wide band gap, 3.7 eV, and the Ti defect sites present problems for the photovoltaic
      applications Surface modification, e.g. attachment of charge-transfer ligands, is one of the
      most effective approaches to modify the optical absorption spectrum and restore the sixfold
      coordination of Ti sites. In order to study the mechanisms of bonding between titanate
      nanotubes and the charge transfer ligands, I chose three different molecules, hydroquinone,
      4-methoxypenol(MEHQ) and catechol. Each of these three molecules is expected to form different
      bonding configuration. The optical and structural properties of titanate nanotubes and the
      three hybrid structures (titanate nanotube/hydroquinone, titanate nanotube/MEHQ and titanate
      nanotube/catechol) are characterized by multiple techniques, such as UV-vis, Raman
      spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy, etc. It is found that by forming a
      bidentate structure, organic molecules (hydroquinone and catechol) and titanate nanotubes can
      form hybrid structures which are relatively stable in the aqueous environment. Also, it was
      demonstrated that there are significant differences in local structures between water-washed
      and acid-washed titanate nanotubes. For acid-washed nanotube, the local structure can be
      changed reversibly into an anatase-like structure by the incorporation of HQ, MEHQ, or CAT.
      This provides important clues for understanding the structure of titanate nanotubes and the
      interaction between ligands and nanotube surfaces. The hybrid system of titanate
      nanotubes/organic molecules has optical absorption significantly beyond 700 nm. This system
      could have very important applications in photocatalysis and photovoltaic devices.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The experiments in this thesis present a foundational study of a nanoelectromechanical
      system that demonstrates high potential for use in a wide range of applications. This system
      incorporates an individual carbon nanotube as a torsional spring for a lithographically
      defined, nanometer-scale metal mass suspended above a substrate. Fabrication and operation of
      such a device is discussed. Investigations are then performed to elucidate a variety of
      material and device characteristics. First, the shear (twisting) modulus of an individual
      singlewall carbon nanotube is measured. This is done through a combination of direct
      electrostatic actuation and computer modeling. Next, the theoretical dependence of singlewall
      carbon nanotube transport properties on torsional strain is confirmed experimentally. Finally,
      the device is used as a self-sensing resonant oscillator. The characteristics of such a device
      and the implications of all results are discussed, as are future directions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis is a study of the dynamics of rational maps without certain periodic
      points, focusing on the roles of critical points. We examine how the dynamics occurring within
      the parameterized family of exceptional rational maps are reected in the parameter space. We
      use Baker's results on the multiplicities of fixed points of a rational map to give a complete
      proof of the classification of exceptional rational maps. In degree 2 and 3 cases exceptional
      rational maps form parameterized families, all of whose members have parabolic fixed point(s).
      In the theory of the iteration of rational maps, the behavior of the critical points of a
      rational map determines the entire dynamics. We produce the parameter space pictures of the
      parameterized families of exceptional rational maps by tracking the orbits of critical points.
      Then We obtain the reduced regions using conformal conjugacy. We compare the parameterized
      family of quadratic exceptional maps and the family of quadratic polynomials focusing on the
      behavior of the critical points. We show that for parameter values on part of the boundary of
      the reduced region, in the dynamical plane there is a forward invariant circle and on it lie
      fixed point(s) as well as critical points.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation traces the emergence of an academic community of archaeologists in
      the contested German-Danish borderland of Schleswig-Holstein from 1830 to 1950 in order to
      explore the uses of the distant past for creating modern national identities. The study
      considers the role of professional scholars in claiming and contesting shared heritages for
      diverging nationalist ends and explains how scholars handled the paradox of participating in
      nation-building projects while maintaining their commitments as members of a transnational
      scholarly community. The study begins in the 1830s with the founding of the Kiel Museum of
      Antiquities, which was the product of collaboration between German and Danish antiquarians. It
      then follows the work of antiquarian scholars in the period of the German-Danish Wars from
      1848 to 1864, when prehistory became a focal point of claims to territory and led antiquarians
      to contest the ownership of artifacts such as the Nydam Boat and the Flensburg Collection. In
      the wake of the wars, the work of scholars such as Johanna Mestorf and Sophus Müller led to a
      renewal of cross-border collaboration, which resulted in the discovery of the lost Viking
      trading town of Haithabu and aided the development of a scientific model for the practice of
      archaeology. The success of research in both countries fostered the production of narratives
      of prehistory based on scientific methods but tied to national histories. Archaeologists such
      as Gustaf Kossinna envisioned the borderland as the site of the earliest Germanic peoples and
      the starting point of Germanic prehistory. The result was a "Nordic
      paradigm" for prehistoric development with strong racial and imperialist overtones
      that coexisted with traditional scientific approaches. The dissertation traces the
      transformation of such thinking in Schleswig-Holstein during the early twentieth century and
      considers its political implications in the Nazi Era, when the transnational context played a
      key role in the engagement of borderland scholars with the Third Reich. The study concludes
      with an appraisal of the fate of nationalist orientations for German and Danish archaeology
      and the impact of borderland archaeologists on their discipline and their respective national
      communities.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) performance is increasing faster than central
      processing unit (CPU) performance. This growth is driven by performance improvements that can
      be divided into the following three categories: algorithmic improvements, architectural
      improvements, and circuit-level improvements. In this dissertation I present techniques that
      improve the rendering performance of graphics hardware measured in speed, power consumption or
      image quality in each of these three areas. At the algorithmic level, I introduce a method for
      using graphics hardware to rapidly and efficiently generate summed-area tables, which are data
      structures that hold pre-computed two-dimensional integrals of subsets of a given image, and
      present several novel rendering techniques that take advantage of summed-area tables to
      produce dynamic, high-quality images at interactive frame rates. These techniques improve the
      visual quality of images rendered on current commodity GPUs without requiring modifications to
      the underlying hardware or architecture. At the architectural level, I propose modifications
      to the architecture of current GPUs that add conditional streaming capabilities. I describe a
      novel GPU-based ray-tracing algorithm that takes advantage of conditional output streams to
      reduce the memory bandwidth requirements by over an order of magnitude times when compared to
      previous techniques. At the circuit level, I propose a compute-on-demand paradigm for the
      design of high-speed and energy-efficient graphics components. The goal of the
      compute-on-demand paradigm is to only perform computation at the bit-level when needed. The
      compute-on-demand paradigm exploits the data-dependent nature of computation, and thereby
      obtains speed and energy improvements by optimizing designs for the common case. This approach
      is illustrated with the design of a high-speed Z-comparator that is implemented using
      asynchronous logic. Asynchronous or "clockless" circuits were chosen for my
      implementations since they allow for data-dependent completion times and reduced power
      consumption by disabling inactive components. The resulting circuit-level implementation runs
      over 1.5 times faster while on dissipating 25% the energy of a comparable synchronous
      comparator for the average case. Also at the circuit-level, I introduce a novel implementation
      of counterflow pipelining, which allows two streams of data to flow in opposite directions
      within the same pipeline without the need for complex arbitration. The advantages of this
      implementation are demonstrated by the design of a high-speed asynchronous Booth multiplier.
      While both the comparator and the multiplier are useful components of a graphics pipeline, the
      objective of this work was to propose the new design paradigm as a promising alternative to
      current graphics hardware design practices.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Plants, like animals, can recognize specific pathogens by virtue of a highlyevolved
      immune system. Recognition of pathogens by plants leads to a well-defined series of outputs,
      including production of reactive oxygen species, cell wall thickening, and a form of
      programmed cell death called the Hypersensitive Response (HR). At the forefront of this
      recognition process are the disease Resistance (R) genes. The proteins encoded by R genes are
      positive regulators of cell death and thus their accumulation is tightly regulated. Here I
      present evidence implicating cytosolic HSP90 as a central figure in the maintenance of
      appropriate R protein levels. Cytosolic HSP90 is encoded by four genes in our model plant
      system, Arabidopsis thaliana. I present data for genetic interactions between two of these
      HSP90 paralogs. I also demonstrate a physical interaction between HSP90 and RAR1 and SGT1, two
      proteins previously identified as playing a role in R protein accumulation. Consistent with
      the physical interaction, double mutant analyses uncovered a genetic interaction between HSP90
      and SGT1. Furthermore mutant forms of HSP90 and RAR1 reveal that changes in their ability to
      physically interact with each other and with SGT1 can explain the phenotypes of the mutants in
      planta. I also describe a genetic screen to identify new additional loci required for the
      function of the Arabidopsis R gene, RPM1. The phenotype of one mutant identified in this
      screen suggests that transcriptional regulation of R genes may play a more significant role in
      maintaining R protein levels than previously expected.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation reads seven recent texts about Mexican Indians in light of previous
      critiques of indigenismo. It asserts that literary indigenismo and its inherent contradictions
      persist alongside "hybrid" genres such as testimonio and also
      indigenous-produced literatura indígena, which is steadily growing in influence. The
      introductory chapter gives a brief overview of literary indigenismo in Mexico, citing critics
      Antonio Cornejo Polar, Joseph Sommers, Cynthia Steele and Analisa Taylor. It establishes
      precedents for the readings in subsequent chapters. Chapter 2 treats Graciela Limón's Erased
      Faces and argues that the influence of indigenismo is still evident in novels produced as late
      as the early twenty-first century. Changes and limitations in the testimonio novel are
      examined in Memorial del tiempo o Vía de las conversaciones by Jesús Morales Bermúdez [chapter
      3]. The role of the author in testimonio as well as the emergence of literatura indígena is
      the subject of chapter 4. Distinct differences between texts produced by indigenous and
      non-indigenous authors are explored via a reading of Javier Castellanos Martínez' Cantares de
      los vientos primerizos/Wila che be ze lhao: Novela zapoteca [chapter 5]. The final chapter
      examines four recent films/videos by indigenous and non-indigenous filmmakers: Día de muertos
      en la tierra de los murciélagos [K'in Santo ta Sotz'leb] by Pedro Daniel López López, the
      Chiapas Media Project's Zapata's Garden, Japón by Carlos Reygadas and John Sayles' Men with
      Guns. Based on the experiences of marginalized groups in other countries, I assert that visual
      media offer opportunities beyond those of the novel for a community-based approach to cultural
      production, but that the genre is still susceptible to many of the same pitfalls of
      indigenismo. The study concludes that recent literary and filmic texts reflect Mexican social
      reality, in which indigenous groups continue to struggle to define their identity in the face
      of continued inequality. Increased distribution and study of indigenous-authored texts is a
      path toward meaningful dialogue and progress on this front.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The music of Irish rock band, U2, evinces a compositional process developed by
      musicians of exceptional inexperience who underwent an equally exceptional insular
      development, to become one of the most critically acclaimed rock bands of all time. This
      dissertation uses a variety of resources-principally demos of mature songs from U2's seventh
      studio album, Achtung Baby (1991), recordings of early performances surrounding the recording
      of their debut album, Boy (1980), and video documentary sources chronicling the recording of
      songs from The Unforgettable Fire (1984) and The Joshua Tree (1987)-as a comparative basis for
      an assessment of U2's signature musical style, their aesthetic of song, and their use of the
      recording studio in the realization and development of that aesthetic. U2 arose from the
      post-punk milieu of the late 1970s, that took its lead from the slightly older punks, (the Sex
      Pistols and the Clash), to forge a style distinct from mainstream pop. The members of U2 had
      widely divergent musical tastes and abilities (some bordering on no ability at all) which
      compelled them to begin writing their own music from the outset, typically through
      interminable rehearsal-a form of live sketching. This musical naiveté was expressed through
      highly idiomatic instrumental ensemble styles and aesthetics of song. Their conception of song
      form was broad, accommodating standard forms, but also unusual binary forms where ostensibly
      standard verse/chorus songs mutated into substantially new or modified material around a
      song's midpoint, with no, or limited, return of earlier material. They freely combined
      discrete realizations of simple harmonic patterns, in essence combining multiple versions of
      basic material within a single song, often as sections which conventionally should contrast
      one another. These early acquired habits served them well as their musical sophistication
      grew. The initial live sketching process, the products of which were committed to vinyl with
      Steve Lillywhite producing, gradually moved more into the recording studio which became, under
      the direction of producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, U2's primary creative venue, and the
      situs for their multiple stylistic reinvention</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Post-translational modifications of proteins are a key component of cell signaling. In
      particular, post-translational modifications of histone tails are known to modulate
      transcription of DNA. These modifications function via a number of different noncovalent
      interactions with both DNA and various nuclear proteins. Some relevant modifications include
      methylation or acylation of lysine and the methylation of arginine and are thought to trigger
      binding with aromatic rings (Trp, DNA bases) through cation-pi and amide-pi interactions. In
      order to characterize these biologically relevant interactions, they have been studied within
      the context of beta-hairpin peptide model systems, which enable the description and
      quantification of specific sidechain-sidechain interactions. In our system, the interaction
      between Trp and trimethylated Lys is shown to be worth 1.0 kcal/mol, a stabilization of about
      0.7 kcal/mol over the nonmethylated Lys-Trp interaction. The methylated interaction occurs
      with an enhanced entropic driving force over the unmethylated interaction. Methylation of Arg
      is also shown to enhance its interaction with Trp, by about 0.5 kcal/mol. Additionally, the
      acyl Lys-Trp interaction is found to be equivalent in magnitude to the nonmethylated Lys-Trp
      interaction (0.3 kcal/mol). Acylation of lysine in our model system is shown to induce a
      switch from a cation-pi to an amide-pi interaction. Investigations into neutral analogues of
      trimethylated Lys reveals the critical nature of the cation-pi interaction to the interaction
      of histone tails with chromodomain proteins. This is confirmed both in our beta-hairpin model
      system and with binding studies with the HP1 chromodomain. Additional investigations in this
      thesis include mutational studies of a -hairpin receptor for ATP and the study of a cation-pi
      interaction within a small molecule model system. Through experimental and computational
      studies, the -hairpin receptor for ATP is shown to form a well-defined binding pocket with a
      number of important electrostatic contacts. The cation-pi interaction in the small molecule
      model system is found to prevail in both aqueous and organic solvent, despite the possible
      presence of competing noncovalent interactions. X-ray and computational evidence suggests the
      possible presence of an oxy-arene interaction in organic solvent, but the interpretation of
      conformational differences from NMR data is ambiguous.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to be critical for the active maintenance of
      goal-related information in the face of distraction. Previous studies have demonstrated that
      schizophrenia is associated with changes in the function of the PFC, and is characterized by
      difficulties in the active maintenance of information in working memory and in the ability to
      resist distraction. Two functional neuroimaging experiments were conducted with healthy
      control participants that examined the effects of distracter demand on working memory by
      manipulating both voluntary attention to distracters ("executive") and
      involuntary capture of attention by emotional distracters. Two additional behavioral
      experiments were conducted to assess how processing of these types of distracters would be
      affected in individuals with schizophrenia. It was expected that specific prefrontal
      subregions would be differentially recruited under conditions of increased distracter demand,
      and that the group with schizophrenia would be disproportionately affected by executive, but
      not emotional distraction. The results largely supported the hypotheses, and indicated that
      the ventrolateral PFC was specifically recruited during both executive and emotional
      distraction. The dorsolateral PFC was activated during both active maintenance and executive
      distraction processes, but its activity was significantly disrupted during emotional
      distraction. The group with schizophrenia also showed specific impairments in the allocation
      of attention to executive distracters, but showed similar patterns to controls during
      emotional distraction. The findings suggest that prefrontal subregions may take on specific
      roles in resolving interference, and that dysfunction in these regions may underlie changes in
      distracter processing in schizophrenia.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a complex disorder of unknown etiology. Research
      into the pathophysiology of IBS suggests the involvement of psychological, hormonal,
      immunological, genetic, cardiovascular, and autonomic nervous system factors, as well as
      peripheral and central sensitization of pain signals in the etiology and/or maintenance of
      IBS. Visceral hyperalgesia is consistently observed in IBS patients. However, recent
      investigations have found evidence of somatic hyperalgesia, not seen in earlier studies,
      suggesting the possibility of a dysfunction in central pain regulatory mechanisms. Evidence
      suggests a role for central sensitization in IBS pain. Psychophysical investigations into
      dysregulation of the endogenous pain regulatory mechanisms of temporal summation and diffuse
      noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) have been consistently demonstrated in other chronic pain
      conditions such as Fibromyalgia and Temporomandibular Disorder, which show high comorbidity
      with IBS. The primary objective of this investigation was to explore the role of central
      sensitization in IBS pain by assessing both efferent (DNIC) and afferent (temporal summation)
      central modulation of nociception in IBS patients. Group differences in psychological,
      autonomic nervous system, and general pain measures were also assessed. Forty eight
      pre-menopausal females (27 with IBS) participated in this investigation. No group differences
      were seen in temporal summation or the DNIC effect on temporal summation. Similarly, no group
      differences were seen in any general pain measures or in sympathetic tone. IBS subjects
      reported significantly greater stress than Controls on measures of; state anxiety, depression,
      catastrophizing, and anger-out expression. IBS subjects also demonstrated significantly lower
      levels of DNIC than Controls during noxious tonic conditioning stimuli. However, non-noxious
      conditioning stimuli also produced an apparent DNIC effect in a counterbalanced design. After
      controlling for non-specific effects occurring in the non-painful conditioning protocol
      (distraction, and psychological measures associated with DNIC), IBS subjects continue to show
      deficient DNIC (p &lt; 0.01). This is the second investigation that has attempted to
      account for non-specific effects in the investigation of DNIC. Only by controlling for
      non-specific effects, can evidence of deficient DNIC can be attributed to dysregulation in
      endogenous analgesic mechanisms. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether deficient
      DNIC is a cause or consequence of IBS pain.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Transformations of nitrogen-donor ligands bound to two similar tungsten moieties,
      [Tp[prime]W(CO)[2]]+ and [Tp[prime]W(CO)(PhC?CMe)]+, have been investigated. A variety of
      methods for formation of imido complexes in the [Tp[prime]W(CO)[2]]+ coordination sphere are
      discussed including net hydride abstraction from an N-protio amido complex and electrophilic
      addition to a nitrido complex. The variable electron-donating ability of the alkyne ligand in
      the [Tp[prime]W(CO)(PhC?CMe)]+ coordination sphere is reflected in the isolation of
      intermediates in the stepwise reduction of acetonitrile and stepwise oxidation of benzylamine.
      Diasteroselective addition to imine ligands has been investigated. A cationic tungsten(IV)
      acetonitrile complex, [Tp[prime]W(O)(CO)(NCMe)]+, containing a [sigma]- bound nitrile ligand,
      has been synthesized. Formation of the neutral tungsten(IV) [eta2]- acetonitrile complex,
      Tp[prime]W(O)(I)(NCMe), has been confirmed based on [1]H, and [13]C NMR spectroscopy and
      reactivity patterns. The [eta2]-nitrile ligand may be replaced with CD[3]CN or
      phenylacetylene. Column chromatography of Tp[prime]W(O)(I)(NCMe) has produced an acylimido
      complex, Tp[prime]W(O)(I)(NC(O)Me), in addition to a product of dimerization,
      Tp[prime](O)(I)WNC(Me)C(Me)NW(I)(O)Tp[prime]. Methylation of the [eta2]-nitrile has been
      accomplished utilizing MeOTf to form an iminoacyl complex, [Tp[prime]W(O)(I)(MeNCMe)][OTf].
      Cyclic amido and imine complexes of tungsten(II) have been synthesized utilizing pyrrolidine
      as substrate. Oxidation of a pyrrolidine amido complex forms a 1-pyrroline complex.
      Diastereoselective nucleophilic addition to the imine carbon has been accomplished using
      MeMgBr and Li[DBEt[3]] to form a 2-methylpyrrolidine complex (SWRC/RWSC) (&gt;95:5 dr) and
      an [alpha]-deuterated pyrrolidine amido complex (high dr) respectively. The second
      diastereomer (SWSC/RWRC) of the 2-methylpyrrolidine amido complex has been synthesized by
      hydride addition to a 2-methyl-1-pyrroline complex. Three, four, and six-membered nitrogen
      heterocycle-ligated tungsten complexes have been synthesized and characterized in the
      [Tp[prime]W(CO)(PhC?CR)]+ (R = Me, Ph) coordination sphere. Successful synthesis of aziridine
      complexes has been achieved at low temperature. A series of azetidine complexes have been
      synthesized and structurally characterized. Addition of a MeMgBr to a chiral cationic
      1-azetine complex results predominantly in formation of one diastereomer (SWRC/RWSC) of the
      resulting 2-methylazetidine complex (96:4 dr). Synthesis and X-ray characterization of a
      2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine complex has been achieved. Subsequent addition of base results in
      formation of an enamido complex. Addition of [D+] to the enamido [beta]-carbon results in
      little diastereoselectivity in the formation of the deuterated product.</mods:abstract>

      child sexual abuse (CSA) was compared to the timing of incidents among adolescents not
      reported to have been abused. Information was obtained from previously collected retrospective
      observations. Reliability of information collected was assessed by conducting a reliability
      study and reviewing a select number of records of subjects. An Independent Samples t-test
      analysis was performed to test the hypothesis that adolescents with reports of CSA experience
      more incidents during the evening than their non-CSA counterparts. Significant findings
      revealed higher total co-morbid diagnoses, higher diagnoses of PTSD, and gender differences in
      behavior shown. However, no significant group differences in frequency or time of acting out
      were found. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the function of acting out,
      as well as to creating appropriate prevention and treatment strategies to help reduce
      incidents and improve adolescent well-being.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The military harangue, known in Spanish as the arenga, enables a commander to motivate
      his men before combat and can be found from ancient times to present in historical and
      literary descriptions of battles. "The Arenga in the Literature of Medieval
      Spain" examines the characteristics and role of the military harangue in Spain's
      literary texts from a variety of perspectives: rhetorical appeals, themes, effectiveness,
      eloquence, structure, and similarities with other medieval rhetorical arts. The study first
      defines what constitutes an arenga and identifies its place within rhetoric (I. Defining the
      Harangue: The Arenga in Rhetoric). It then looks at harangues originating from Antiquity,
      examining Virgil's examples and those found in a medieval Spanish translation of Thucydides
      (II. Harangues from Classical Texts). Finally, it studies examples found in Spanish poetry and
      prose, dedicating two chapters to the most important harangues written in Spain during the
      Middle Ages (III. Thirteenth-Century Spanish Literary Arengas; IV. Fifteenth-Century Spanish
      Literary Arengas). The concluding chapter (V. Conclusion) is followed by an Appendix
      containing the full text of each harangue, a Works Cited, and a Selected Bibliography for
      further research.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Histone proteins packages newly synthesized DNA into higher organizations. During DNA
      synthesis in metazoans, there is a high demand for biosynthesis of histone proteins. Strict
      regulation of histone protein expression in the S phase is achieved by unique structure of
      histone mRNA. Unlike other eukaryotic mRNAs, histone mRNAs end with a stem-loop, rather than a
      polyA tail. The stem-loop binds the stem loop binding protein (SLBP), a novel RNA binding
      protein that is conserved among metazoans. Xenopus laevis has two forms of SLBP. xSLBP1 is the
      homolog of hSLBP and N-terminus of the both proteins are shown to stimulate translation of
      histone mRNA. xSLBP2, the oocyte specific form, maintains high similarity to hSLBP only in the
      RBD. xSLBP2 does not stimulate histone mRNA translation, but instead represses histone mRNAs
      during early oogenesis. xSLBP2 is degraded during oocyte maturation, and then xSLBP1 binds
      histone mRNAs coinciding with the timing of translational activation. I have characterized a
      motif in the N-terminus of xSLBP1 and hSLBP which is responsible for translational activity.
      The motif, DWX(3-4)VEE, is highly conserved among vertebrates. I demonstrated that this motif
      interacts with a novel factor, named as SLBP-Interacting Protein 1 (SLIP1). Interestingly,
      SLIP1 stimulates translation of histone mRNA to higher levels in the presence of SLBP. SLBP
      mutants that can not iii stimulate histone mRNA translation are also incapable of interacting
      with SLBP. Previously, it had been reported that eukaryotic polyadenylated mRNAs were
      translationally stimulated by circularization via protein-protein interactions. I showed that
      SLIP1 interacts with translation initiation factors IF4GI and II. Possibly, histone mRNA forms
      a closed loop similar to polyadenylated mRNAs during translation. Together with Jeremy Kupsco
      and Bob Duronio, I genetically investigated the role of SLBP and SLIP1 in Drosophila
      melanogaster. We identified a region in the N-terminus of dSLBP which has an essential
      post-processing function in Drosophila during early development. We demonstrated that dSLIP1
      interacts with dSLBP. We characterized the SLIP1 interaction motif in the Nterminus of SLBP,
      (KFX(2-3)VEKE), which is similar to DWX(3-4)VEE motif in vertebrates. Both dSLBP and SLIP1
      null mutant flies are embryonically lethal, probably due to a defect in translation of histone
      mRNAs. We conclude that the SLIP1-SLBP interaction is crucial for viability of Drosophila
      during early development.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>There is a growing body of literature dedicated to elucidating the mechanisms involved
      in behavioral sensitization. The following studies examined the ability of alterations in PKA
      signaling (via genetic knockout) and CRF signaling (via pharmacological blockade) to modulate
      ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization and restraint stress-induced crosssensitization.
      Experiment 1 utilized the RII[beta] knockout model to determine if alterations in PKA
      signaling affect locomotor activation in response to ethanol as well as the development of
      ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization. RII[beta-/-] mice consistently showed significantly
      greater ethanol-induced locomotor activity relative to RII[beta+/+] mice. RII[beta-/-] mice
      also showed increased sensitivity to ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization, an effect that
      may be dependent on genetic background and/or testing paradigm. Importantly, increased
      locomotor activity by RII[beta-/-] mice was specific to ethanol injections, absent following
      saline injections, and not associated with altered blood ethanol levels. Experiment 2
      attempted to discern a few of the mechanisms underlying the restraint stress-induced
      cross-sensitized response to ethanol in mice. Chronic exposure to restraint stress (2hrs for
      10 days) induced a cross-sensitized response to ethanol in two commercially available inbred
      strains of mice, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J. The RII[beta] knockout mouse model was also utilized to
      test if enhanced sensitivity to stress might be a factor contributing to the previously
      observed heightened sensitivity to ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization in these mice.
      RII[beta-/-] and RII[beta+/+] showed no differences in the effect of stress on ethanolinduced
      locomotor activity. Finally, pretreatment with CRF Receptor 1 antagonist, CP- 154,526, prior
      to restraint stress sessions in male DBA/2J mice failed to block the acquisition of a
      cross-sensitized response to ethanol. Experiment 3 used a CRF Receptor 1 antagonist,
      CP-154,526, in an attempt to block the acquisition and expression of ethanol-induced locomotor
      sensitization in male DBA/2J mice. Pretreatment with CP-154,526 was ineffective in blocking
      the acquisition of a sensitized response to ethanol. In contrast, pretreatment with CP-154,526
      effectively blocked expression of a sensitized response in DBA/2J mice that had been
      previously sensitized to the locomotor stimulating effects of ethanol. These effects were not
      attributable to alterations in blood ethanol levels, and ethanol naïve DBA/2J mice when
      pretreated with CP-154,526 show no such reductions in locomotor activity in response to
      ethanol. These experiments suggest a role for both PKA and CRF signaling in the mechanisms
      underlying ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization. Additionally, the ability of chronic
      restraint stress to elicit a cross-sensitized response to ethanol in mice is demonstrated.
      Ultimately, it remains unclear if alterations in PKA or CRF signaling are involved in the
      mechanisms associated with restraint stress-induced cross sensitization.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Cinquecento Rome was a city like no other, with her central papal court and the many
      mini-courts of Cardinals and wealthy families; the decentralized structure of competing
      households radiating out from the papal court offered numerous venues for the creation and
      performance of secular music. This dissertation offers a series of case studies of the Italian
      madrigal as practiced in the city to the early 1550s. The madrigal, often treated as a genre
      of Florentine origin, has deep roots in Rome, a result of the tight bond that united the
      cities during the Medici papacies. Chapter One establishes the state of secular music in the
      years before and early on in the madrigal's development. It was during this period that
      Verdelot arrived in Florence and, after the Sack of Rome, the Madrigali … libro primo de la
      Serena, the first print to use the word "madrigal" in its title, was
      published in Rome. Chapters Two and Three center on the papal court of Paul III, during whose
      reign Costanzo Festa and Jacques Arcadelt both served in the Cappella Sistina. Arcadelt's
      Quarto libro di madrigali, 153924, which includes pieces by the papal singers Festa, Morales,
      Yvo Barry, and Leonardo Barrè, marks the adoption of the Florentine idiom by composers with no
      known association to the city and suggests the extent to which the genre would soon dominate
      Italian secular composition. Chapter Four demonstrates the breadth of Roman music with a case
      study of Jacques du Pont's Cinquanta Stanze del Bembo; this large-scale work, by a Frenchman
      who was employed not within the papal court but by the wealthy Florentine Cardinal Giovanni
      Salviati, sets an early Carnival text by the Venetian scholar Pietro Bembo. Chapter Five
      presents the development of distinctly Roman repertories in circles independent of papal or
      cardinalate patronage. Hubert Naich's Exercitium seraficium, the black note anthologies, and
      the arioso madrigal prints of Antonio Barrè, who published his own works alongside those by
      composers such as Lasso, Palestrina, Lupacchino, and several composers from or active in
      Naples, all speak to the diversity of the Roman madrigal by mid-century.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study is to examine the transactions among a first-grade
      struggling reader's reading abilities, reading-related cognitions, reading motivation,
      classroom behavior, and her individual and classroom reading instruction. In addition, I
      examined whether the transactions vary over time within the context of the Rural Early
      Literacy Initiative. Using a case study methodology, I analyzed observations of individual and
      classroom instruction, interviews of the teacher and student, assessments of the student's
      reading abilities, and teacher questionnaires. This study provides early evidence of the
      complex, reciprocal relationships that exist across multiple child and instructional domains
      related to reading. Within the child's system, I observed transactions among reading
      instructional level, all reading sub-processes, reading motivation (particularly reading
      self-efficacy and reading involvement), and classroom behavior (particularly distractibility,
      independence, and task orientation) for one first-grade African-American girl. Most striking,
      her reading instructional level, reading sub-processes, and reading motivation reciprocally
      interrelated to one another, as mediated by reading practice. I also observed the ways in
      which her reading abilities and motivation affected her classroom behavior and witnessed
      suggestive evidence that this relationship was bidirectional. Individual reading instruction
      that was matched to the student's instructional needs displayed clear transactions across the
      child system. To a less observable degree, I also saw ways in which classroom instruction
      transacted with individual instruction as well as the child system. The most notable
      instructional influence, the teacher-student relationship, exerted a strong reciprocal
      influence on reading sub-processes and instructional level, reading motivation, classroom
      behavior, and individual and classroom instruction, mainly via the dramatic increase in
      positive instructional and emotional exchanges between the student and teacher. The
      transactional variations over the course of the study belong to one of three types of systems:
      a dysfunctional system, then a rapidly self-correcting system, and finally a selfsustaining
      system.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Author of nine texts published by Editions de Minuit, Belgian writer Jean-Philippe
      Toussaint emerged onto the literary scene with his first novel in 1985. From the beginning,
      humor has been one of his trademarks, slapstick and crude at times, darker, more subversive,
      and subtler at others. While scholars all recognize the presence of humor in his works, none
      have really concentrated solely on this author's novels with the depth that they demand in
      terms of why they make us smile and even laugh. Hence, this is precisely what this
      dissertation accomplishes. The focus revolves around all of the playful aspects of Toussaint's
      texts in order to show how the author, as he has stated himself, privileges style over story.
      In the 1980's and 1990's, his works were often characterized as minimalist, and it is rather
      from this perspective that so many studies have been published. However, as his writing has
      evolved over the years, this description no longer seems to be valid in relation especially to
      his most recent works. Thorough examinations of semantic and syntactic fields have been
      initiated in this study in order to link the author's ludic sensibilities to his style,
      despite the fact that the content of the texts often contains much humor. Furthermore, the
      notion of intertextuality as a ludic device as well as incongruities in both text and context
      are also explored in detail. Toussaint alludes to numerous authors' works, from Pascal,
      Flaubert, Gide, and Proust, to Apollinaire, Beckett, Nabokov, and Kawabata among others.
      Although the stories themselves are often humorous on the surface, the vast pleasure of this
      author's texts resides in the writing itself, the narrative style and the dialogue between his
      and other texts, details sometimes so subtle that they are easily overlooked.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The formation of organs during development requires that cell proliferation occur in a
      coordinated fashion. Furthermore, mis-regulation of the cell cycle during adulthood is
      associated with cancer and other human diseases. The molecular pathways that govern the
      eukaryotic cell cycle have been extensively studied, however the mechanisms by which the cell
      cycle is regulated in a tissue specific manner during development are not well understood. In
      this work, we explore the regulation of cell proliferation within the developing heart, as
      well as the maintenance of proliferating cardiac progenitor cells. The T-box transcription
      factor TBX5 is expressed within the developing heart and is required for heart morphogenesis
      in vertebrates. Additionally, mutations to TBX5 have been associated with the human congenital
      heart defect Holt-Oram syndrome. Despite the evolutionarily conserved role for TBX5 in heart
      development, the precise cellular requirement for TBX5 has not been defined. We show that one
      of the earliest defects in the TBX5-depleted Xenopus embryos is a reduction in cardiac cell
      number due to a decrease in mitotic index. We have further demonstrated that TBX5 is both
      necessary and sufficient to control cardiac cell cycle progression, and that depleting TBX5
      leads to arrest in late G1 or early S-phase of the cell cycle. In this way, TBX5 is required
      to establish cardiac morphology during development. Finally we have identified a requirement
      for the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 in the maintenance of proliferating cardiac progenitor
      cells downstream of FGF signaling. These studies show that SHP-2 is required for the
      maintenance of cardiac precursors, and that in the absence of SHP-2 activity, there is an
      increase in programmed cell death specifically in the cardiac precursor cells and pharyngeal
      mesoderm. When SHP-2 activity is inhibited at a later stage, when many cells have exited the
      cell cycle, cardiac differentation is able to proceed, however the number of proliferating
      cells within the heart is substantially reduced. These data suggest a specific requirement for
      SHP-2 in the survival of proliferating cardiac progenitor cells.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Individuals from diverse status backgrounds pursue entrepreneurship, and approximately
      half of those who seek to start businesses--nascent entrepreneurs--form startup teams of two
      or more persons. Using data from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED), I
      examined how individual status characteristics influence group processes and entrepreneurial
      outcomes. I also studied how team status characteristics and group processes influence
      entrepreneurial outcomes. I found that status characteristics influenced the assistance team
      members provide to their startups. My results showed gender to be a significant status
      characteristic in that gender composition influenced assistance provisions, and secondly that
      men and women differed in perceptions of how status affected assistance provisions in their
      teams. I also found that the levels and types of assistance that team members provided to
      their startup teams reduced their odds of abandoning startup activities and increased their
      odds of establishing operational businesses or remaining active in entrepreneurship. However,
      I found little evidence that individual status, team diversity, or team relationships directly
      influenced startup outcomes for nascent entrepreneurs. I did find that average status of
      startup teams and close relationships among team members sometimes improved respondents'
      entrepreneurial outcomes when team members provided assistance at high levels. Additionally, I
      found that the influence of individual status characteristics on entrepreneurial outcomes were
      contingent on team membership and the levels of assistance team members provided. Therefore,
      although my results do not pinpoint the sorts of startup teams potential nascent entrepreneurs
      should form for optimal results given their status characteristics, they do demonstrate that
      status expectations influence group processes and that, much more so than resources
      originating from entrepreneurs' status characteristics, group processes influence the
      conditions of startups over time.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Of all American authors, poet/novelist James Agee might be one of the most misread and
      maligned. Overcome by his larger-than-life personality and biography, the work of Agee is
      frequently dismembered and read in pieces - mainly as works that might help to divine more of
      the author's personal life and inner voice. This work calls for a reevaluation of the modern
      American fiction writer's relationship to his text by working towards a new recognition of the
      aesthetic. In particular, this study seeks to re-imagine the wounded body of James Agee's
      fiction as a whole entity with a discernable structure and singular voice. It takes as its
      unifying principle the peculiar obsession throughout Agee's fiction with dismembered, tortured
      bodies. Unraveling the thread of this thematic preoccupation allows a careful reader of Agee's
      fiction to plot a course for his career in fiction, from the hybridized Let Us Now Praise
      Famous Men to the paternal nightmare of A Death in the Family and the ritual violence of The
      Morning Watch. The study will also discuss in detail - and for the first time - portions of
      Agee's unpublished works that will help to fill in gaps between the author's major fiction. By
      manifesting a clear and unified vision for Agee's artistic endeavor, this study will help to
      construct not only a methodology for Agee's fiction but also a new semiotics which emphasizes
      American modernist writers' works on their own terms.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This research explores the issues of family farming and sustainable practices at two
      levels. On one level, it compares and contrasts the sustainable farming practices of farming
      families in Štitar, Croatia with the smallholders as described by the theory of cultural
      ecology. On another level, it contrasts the European Union's (EU) Common Agricultural Policy's
      (CAP) vision of sustainability to that posited by cultural ecologists and it seeks to
      understand the reaction of Štitar farmers to the CAP. My research goal is to explore how the
      social, economic and environmental health and status of the village, which is influenced by
      local traditional ethics and agricultural practices, fits with the CAP goals of rural
      preservation and agricultural sustainability. My research questions explore how Croatian local
      farmers have adapted to the farming regulations of the past political regimes, in an attempt
      to provide an understanding of how current local agricultural practices fit the EU's visions
      of sustainable agricultural systems that are competitive, environmentally sound, and socially
      just. Hypotheses are framed to illuminate ways in which these rural dwellers and family
      farming households are adapting to the international policies that are pushing them toward the
      global market and away from their goals of subsistence and independent social viability.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This project examines the role of illustration in the serialized fiction of William
      Makepeace Thackeray, Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins, and Elizabeth Gaskell during the period
      of 1847-1868, when illustrated fiction reached its height in Victorian England. Illustrations
      featured in much of 19th-century British fiction, but these images, at one time paramount in
      the reading and marketing of such literature, rarely receive close attention in literary
      criticism and the literature classroom. Not only does this absence of such a vital textual
      element compromise the experience of these works, but it prevents the modern reader from
      engaging with and understanding the complex relationship between reading and seeing.
      Interweaving literary theory regarding the physical and conceptual space of the book and
      literary analysis of the complex relationship between image and word, I situate a canonical
      text by each author in its historical period and the Victorian reading marketplace as I
      explore the influence of illustration on the reception of the written text for today's
      readers. Examining these illustrations demonstrates the complex illuminative effects of
      Thackeray's working as both author and illustrator in Vanity Fair; the reflection of Dickens's
      textual content and mixed narrative style in Our Mutual Friend; the translation of an English
      novel in an American journal and the presence of a visual meta-narrative in The Moonstone; and
      the visual manipulation, or revision, of key elements in Gaskell's Wives and Daughters. In
      analyzing specific illustrations and the ways in which they mediate, revise, and alternately
      support or resist the text to moderate reader understanding and interpretation, I consider the
      variety and expression of authorial control and the act of interpretation as implicitly
      emphasized and challenged through the relationship between image and text in each work. In
      reclaiming these visual elements I assert the importance of interdisciplinarity in literary
      studies as well as the pedagogical significance of expanding traditional critical approaches

               <mods:abstract>The analysis of proteomic mixtures is quite complex due to the abundance of species to
      characterize. Most modern methods utilize a bottom-up approach, but as mass spectrometer
      methods improve, the need to high-resolution top-down methods have also been identified. The
      separation of intact proteins for top-down proteomics by reverse-phase liquid chromatography
      (RPLC) has received renewed interest due to the ease of coupling to ESIMS. Unfortunately,
      modern RPLC methods do not have high enough resolving power to analyze complex proteomic
      mixtures with great success. It has been well documented that the use of smaller diameter
      packing material in a chromatographic column can greatly increase the resolving power. These
      particles, which have a diameter of &lt;2 micrometers, require a substantially higher
      backpressure to produce an equivalent flow. Ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC)
      can produce pressures up to 100 kpsi and can be used with these smaller particles. Previous
      work has explored isocratic separations small organics and gradient separation of peptides.
      This work will investigate gradient UHPLC of intact proteins.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Using data from a longitudinal survey of adolescents, this dissertation develops a
      social network-based measure of school bullying. It considers three research questions: 1)
      what accounts for racial disparities in bullying perpetration? 2) Are there racial differences
      in the consequences of involvement in bullying? 3) What factors affect the likelihood of
      interracial bullying? The first paper yields two divergent but not mutually exclusive views of
      bullying, the first based on theories of delinquency, the second derived from the concept of
      status insecurity. Bullies are less attached to school and parents, have more conflictive home
      lives, are themselves picked on, have aggressive friends, and are more likely to be depressed,
      findings consistent with theories of delinquency. At the same time, bullies are also seemingly
      "normal" kids who participate in extra-curricular activities, are relatively
      popular, have attractive friends, and may come from high socio-economic backgrounds. None of
      the variables mediate the higher perpetration rates of African-Americans and Latinos. The
      second paper tests the relationship between bullying involvement and five outcomes:
      popularity, school attachment, depression, anxiety, and suicide attempts. Bullying others
      increases popularity, but also increases anxiety and depression. Being bullied decreases
      popularity and increases depression and the likelihood of suicide attempts. With one
      exception, the effect of bullying on mental health and school attachment does not vary by
      race. Minority students who bully others make larger gains in popularity than whites,
      suggesting one possible explanation for their higher perpetration rates. The third paper
      examines the prevalence of bullying relationships among dyads. Bullying is most likely to be
      intra- rather than inter-racial, even after controlling for propinquity and social distance.
      Racial diversity of the school increases the prevalence of bullying, but does not influence
      the prevalence of interracial bullying. Bullying is also less likely to cross gender lines,
      but boys bully girls more often than girls bully boys. Girls bully each other more often than
      boys bully each other. Bullying is more likely to occur between those who are socially close
      and of similar social status. More attractive and physically developed adolescents are more
      likely to bully their less developed and less attractive peers.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The cycloisomerization of 1,5-dienes bearing nucleophilic traps with electrophilic
      trisphosphine Pt(II) complexes generates a cationic Pt-alkyl species which is stable to
      protonolysis by bulky diaryl ammonium acids. An investigation of tridentate pincer ligand
      effects in a model system where the alkyl group was -Me revealed that small electron donating
      substituents at phosphorus enhanced the rate of protonolysis by almost two orders of
      magnitude. Mechanistic experiments suggested that protonation at Pt generated a 5-coordinate
      intermediate which eliminated methane by reductive coupling and rapid associative ligand
      substitution. The large difference in protonolysis rates between pincer and non-pincer systems
      was attributed to torsional strain inherent to square planar pincer systems. Polyene
      cyclizations with dicationic Pt complexes typically resulted in a large forward rate constant
      for cyclization with diastereoselectivity of the polycyclic products governed by the
      Stork-Eschenmoser postulate. Ligand effects, more specifically electronics, were observed to
      affect the mode of cyclization (concerted or stepwise). The first direct observation of the
      equilibrating species in a polycyclization reaction (Pt( 2-alkene) and Pt-alkyl) was made
      using the electron donating bis(2- diethylphosphinoethyl)ethylphosphine (EtPPPEt) ligand and a
      1,5-dienyl sulfonamide. Cyclization was determined to be stepwise in nature, generating the
      more thermodynamically favored cis ring junction in the 6,5-bicyclic Pt-alkyl product. The
      variables which affect the cyclization equilibrium were investigated and included: solvent
      polarity, metal electrophilicity, acid/base strength, and ring strain. These factors were used
      as a guideline to control stereoselectivity in polyene cascade cyclizations. Medium range
      stereocontrol was observed using a 1,5-dienol substrate but such control was not present in
      the cyclization of trienol substrates. The effects of ligand design on Pt(II) catalyzed
      cyclopropanation reactions was also investigated. Deconstructing the PPP ligand framework into
      a combination of mono- and bidentate phosphine ligands allowed for a modular approach to
      catalyst optimization. The optimal achiral catalyst for the cyclopropanation of 1,6- and
      1,7-dienes was found to be (dppm)(PMe3)Pt2+. This catalyst was extremely electrophilic and
      carbophilic; increasing rates by a factor of 20 and allowing for more functional group
      tolerance. An asymmetric ligand with a similar bite angle to dppm was also synthesized and
      tested for enantioselective catalysis.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This is a work of historical geography examining the role of an Indian-origin
      transportation route in the development of the colonial settlement system that emerged in the
      North Carolina Piedmont during the mid 18th century. This system has evolved in modern times
      into an important polycentric urban region, and the area's current inhabitants attribute this
      pattern to the Indian route, the Indian Trading Path. The relationship between the route and
      settlement development has not previously been tested, however. Previous work in settlement
      development geography has in fact treated the North American colonial landscape as a blank
      slate and failed to take account of landscape features left by an area's earlier occupants.
      This work comprised a process of transforming archival data-several thousand records from the
      earliest documented European settlement of the area-to geographic information in a GIS
      (geographic information system) and then to geographic knowledge through analysis of spatial
      and temporal pattern in the GIS. A two-scale model was used to explain the process by which
      the Indian Trading Path could affect emerging settlement patterns at the level of both town
      and regional system. While the model and results are geographically specific and not meant to
      apply to backcountry settlement in a general sense, the overall approach used can profitably
      be applied to other locations, both in terms of technical methodology and in terms of
      realistically assessing the role of indigenous landscape features in colonial outcomes.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation consists of three distinct chapters, which develop and test a the-
      ory of Proportional Message Reception. Chapter 1 outlines the theory of Proportional Message
      Reception and the resulting hypothesis of uniform opinion change. I test the hypothesis using
      individual{level and sub{aggregate data on Vietnam attitudes and defense spending preferences.
      Chapter 2 examines the implications of Proportional Message reception and uniform opinion
      change for welfare attitudes and inequality in the United States. Chapter 3 questions previous
      conceptions of opinion aggrega- tion by showing that all segments of the public update their
      Policy Mood in response to changing economic conditions. The three chapters show that it is
      the proportion of countervailing messages an individual receives, not the number of messages,
      that matters for opinion change. Furthermore, the analyses demonstrate--in a substantial
      departure from previous literature--that the most and least politically aware segments of the
      public update their opinions at the same time, in the same direction, and in response to the
      same pattern of messages.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This project explores the influence of the past in four works of contemporary Mexican
      literature: the novels Madero, el otro (1989) by Ignacio Solares and Noticias del Imperio
      (1987) by Fernando del Paso; and the plays Entre Villa y una mujer desnuda (1993) by Sabina
      Berman and La Malinche (2000) by Víctor Hugo Rascón Banda. Drawing on the works of
      poststructuralists like Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Linda Hutcheon, essays by
      Mexican thinkers such as Carlos Fuentes, and theories of temporality posited by Paul Ricoeur
      and Jacques Le Goff, I demonstrate that, through the distortion and demythification of
      historical figures and events, these texts highlight the present-day influence of historical
      events and individuals beyond the causal characteristics assigned them by traditional
      historiography. This effect is used to communicate the active manner in which the isolated
      "past" is engaged with the present. The result is that cause and effect are
      reversed so that the reader is encouraged to engage in a dialectical process with the
      consequences of history in the present.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The goal of this work is to enable more rapid and accurate diagnosis of pathology from
      three-dimensional (3D) medical images by augmenting standard volume rendering techniques to
      display otherwise-occluded features within the volume. When displaying such data sets with
      volume rendering, appropriate selection of the transfer function is critical for determining
      which features of the data will be displayed. In many cases, however, no transfer function is
      able to produce the most useful views for diagnosis of pathology. Flexible Occlusion Rendering
      (FOR) is an addition to standard ray cast volume rendering that modulates accumulated color
      and opacity along each ray upon detecting features indicating the separation between objects
      of the same intensity range. For contrast-enhanced MRI and CT data, these separation features
      are intensity peaks. To detect these peaks, a dualthreshold method is used to reduce
      sensitivity to noise. To further reduce noise and enable control over the spatial scale of the
      features detected, a smoothed version of the original data set is used for feature detection,
      while rendering the original data at high resolution. Separating the occlusion feature
      detection from the volume rendering transfer function enables robust occlusion determination
      and seamless transition from occluded views to non-occluded views of surfaces during virtual
      flythroughs. FOR has been applied to virtual arthroscopy of joints from MRI data. For example,
      survey views of entire shoulder socket surfaces have been rendered to enable rapid evaluation
      by automatically removing the occluding material of the humeral head. Such views are not
      possible with standard volume rendering. FOR has also been successfully applied to virtual
      ureteroscopy of the renal collecting system from CT data, and knee fracture visualization from
      CT data.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Successful cell division requires the equal segregation of the replicated genome. This
      process is carried out by a cellular machine known as the mitotic spindle, which is largely
      conserved across eukaryotes. I have used the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model
      organism to better understand the mechanics of the mitotic spindle and the mechanisms that
      coordinate events during mitosis. Prior to segregation, sister chromatids form bi-polar
      attachments to microtubules nucleated from the two spindle pole bodies. These attachments are
      mediated by the kinetochores which link centromeric DNA to microtubules. Biorientation of
      sister chromatids results in their alignment at the spindle equator, a state known as
      metaphase. During metaphase, spindle length remains stable. This stability has been largely
      attributed to the activity of microtubule motors in the spindle. I have taken an alternative
      approach to dissecting the forces within the metaphase spindle by examining the role of
      chromatin structure of sister chromatids. By lowering chromatin packaging, I have shown that
      spindle length is directly regulated by the stretching of pericentric chromatin. This result
      demonstrates that chromatin is an important structural member of the metaphase spindle.
      Following metaphase, chromosomes segregate and the cell undergoes cell division to produce two
      daughter cells. I found that during anaphase, a fraction of inner kinetochore proteins
      re-localizes to the spindle midzone. This re-localization requires the activity of a yet
      unidentified motor. Mutation of the inner kinetochore protein Ndc10p results in defects in
      spindle stability and cell division. This mechanism of spatial regulation of kinetochore
      proteins appears to contribute to the coordination of chromosome segregation, spindle
      elongation, and cell division.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Misplaced inventory is a major operational inefficiency in supply chains and it
      happens when items are not in their designated places and hard to find in a store. In this
      thesis, we focus on misplaced inventory and inventory shrinkage, which is a special case of
      inventory misplacement. Information technology is facilitating significant reductions in these
      opera- tional inefficiencies. However, such technologies are generally very expensive to
      implement. This dissertation intends to fill the gap of knowledge about the effects of
      operational inefficiencies in supply chains of various forms and the role of information
      systems in mitigating such inefficiencies that often get reflected in poor performance. We do
      this through three separate essays using analytical research methods. In the first essay,
      Coordination of a Supply Chain under Misplaced Inventory, we consider a supply chain where a
      proportion of the items ordered become unavailable for sale due to misplacement at the
      retailer. We investigate the effects of increasing the proportion of inventory availability at
      the retailer on the profits of the retailer and the manufacturer in vertically integrated and
      decentralized supply chains where we study uncoordinated and coordinated supply chains. In the
      second essay, Misplaced Inventory and RFID: Information and Coordination, we consider Radio
      Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to mitigate the negative effects of inventory
      misplacement. We consider both fixed and variable costs for RFID implementation and assume
      that the fixed cost is shared between the two using an arbitrary proportion while the variable
      cost could be charged to either the retailer or the manufacturer. We characterize the
      incentives of the parties in the supply chain to invest in RFID in vertically integrated,
      uncoordinated and coordinated supply chains. In the third essay, Inventory Management under
      Shrinkage and Customer-Driven Search, we consider a supply chain with a single supplier and
      two retailers under customer search experiencing shrinkage at the retailers, who face
      nonidentical random demands. Through a single-period model, we explore the effects of
      shrinkage and competition on the equilibrium stocking decisions and characterize conditions
      for the parties to benefit from a unilateral reduction in shrinkage.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this dissertation, I examine the use of scripture in the legal documents composed
      by two early Anglo-Saxon intellectual figures, Alcuin of York and king Alfred of Wessex. In my
      introductory chapter, I begin with some general background on the topic, including the
      relationship between secular and ecclesiastical law, and I explain my methodology. In chapter
      two, I consider the Legatine Capitulary of 786, a collection of twenty canons produced by a
      legation sent to England by pope Hadrian to address certain abuses. This document was composed
      during Alcuin.s first return visit to York after he left for Charlemagne.s royal court, and
      there has been ongoing debate about the extent of his role in drafting it. By comparing the
      scriptural passages quoted in this text with parallel quotations in the remainder of Alcuin.s
      work, I show that he had significant influence on these canons. Next, in chapter three, I
      consider the debate over the source of Alfred.s extended translation from Exodus that serves
      as an introduction to his law code. While Fournier argued almost a century ago that Alfred
      used a Hiberno-Latin tract known as the Liber ex lege Moysi, his thesis has remained unproven.
      I construct a working edition of the Liber and compare it to Alfred.s Prologue. My analysis
      not only upholds Fournier.s thesis, but also shows that Alfred was using the Liber in a way
      consistent with the ideology of the Irish Church of the time. In my final chapter, I draw some
      general conclusions about the use of scripture in Anglo-Saxon law. Specifically, I look at (1)
      the implications of using Latin or the vernacular for a law code, (2) the way Anglo-Saxon
      legalists perceived the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, and (3) how scripture
      could be used to justify legal reform. Finally, I end with some thoughts about future research
      in this area.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Battista Guarini's Il pastor fido (1590) holds a prominent place in the history of the
      Italian madrigal. Originating in the settings of Luca Marenzio and Giaches de Wert in 1594-95,
      the Pastor fido madrigal tradition stretches well into the seventeenth century and involves
      nearly every major madrigalist of the time. This study of Marenzio's Pastor fido settings
      first considers the cultural and historical milieu that surrounded the composer in 1590s
      Rome-the literary debates, patronage, and the interactions of various intellectuals associated
      with the play (including Guarini, Torquato Tasso, Cinzio Aldobrandini, Scipione Gonzaga, and
      Leonardo Salviati)-and the effects this setting potentially had on his work. Detailed analyses
      of his Pastor fido (and other) madrigals then examine Marenzio's treatment of Guarini's
      poetry, elucidating how structure and text are integrated in his works to produce musical
      readings that are highly sophisticated and show remarkable sensitivity to the details of the
      poem. At the same time, the study reexamines our understanding of mode and how modal music
      operates. Following a review of prevailing perceptions of mode and musical structure in
      pre-Baroque music, a new approach to the analysis of late- Renaissance polyphony is developed
      by incorporating principles of sixteenth-century theory into the notions of hierarchical and
      teleological structure of Schenkerian analysis. This analytical system recognizes the text and
      music as central elements of the music's structure, and deals with pre-tonal music in a way
      that is both effective and historically accountable. Finally, this dissertation calls into
      question current views of the broader function of the madrigal in music history, and of how
      the madrigal functioned as a rendering of the lyric io for its contemporary readership. The
      analyses of Marenzio's (and Wert's) madrigals demonstrate the ability of the madrigal to
      project and accommodate at once multiple interpretative dimensions. This presentation of the
      text proves entirely lyric in nature, and stands distinctly apart from the dramatic mode of
      presentation of monody. The madrigal, therefore, is viewed as a viable and exceptionally
      intuitive vehicle for the handling of lyric poetry, and not as a striving precursor in the
      development of dramma per musica.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation presents two theoretical predictions of the behavior of solutions of
      nematic liquid crystal polymers when subjected to small amplitude flows that are oscillatory
      in time. First, we review theoretical models for predicting the behavior of nematic liquid
      crystals, in- cluding Leslie-Ericksen theory, which only attempts to capture the mean
      direction of molecular orientation, and Doi-Hess kinetic theory, which defines a probability
      density function on the unit sphere for the molecular orientation and also the mesocscopic
      orientation tensor models derived from it, which are the models that we will examine. In
      Chapter 2, we examine shear flow in the monodomain limit, in which there are no spatial
      gradients in molecular orientation, and we use multiple timescale perturbation analysis to
      capture very slowly developing effects in the dynamic moduli, similar to experimental
      observations. Then, in Chapter 3, we relax the monodomain restriction and examine the effect
      of heterogeneity in the molecular orientation and the choice of two special anchoring
      conditions for the orientation at the plates. We re- cover a Leslie-Ericksen-type prediction,
      formally connect imposed stress and imposed velocity boundary conditions in shear flow, and
      establish an equivalence at the level of the storage and loss moduli between shear flow and
      Poiseuille flow.</mods:abstract>

      environment user may place his real hand inside a virtual object. If the virtual environment
      system prevents the user's hand avatar from penetrating the object, the hand avatar must be
      placed somewhere other than the user's real hand position. I propose a technique, named
      MACBETH (Management of Avatar Conflict By Employment of a Technique Hybrid) for managing the
      position of a user's hand avatar in a natural manner after it has been separated from the
      user's real hand due to collision with a virtual object. This technique balances
      visual/proprioceptive discrepancy in position and velocity by choosing each so that they are
      equally detectable. To gather the necessary information to implement MACBETH, I performed user
      studies to determine users' detection thresholds for visual/proprioceptive discrepancy in hand
      position and velocity. I then ran a user study to evaluate MACBETH against two other
      techniques for managing the hand avatar position: the rubber-band and incremental-motion
      techniques. Users rated MACBETH as more natural than the other techniques and preferred
      MACBETH over both. Users performed better on a hand navigation task with MACBETH than with the
      incremental-motion technique and performed equally well as with the rubber-band technique.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation explores the treatment of the English common people, their
      communities, and their values in a variety of early modern dramatic texts, including
      Shakespeare's Henry IV plays, Henry V, and The Merry Wives of Windsor; Thomas Heywood's Edward
      IV and If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody plays, Thomas Dekker's The Shoemaker's Holiday,
      Rowley, Dekker and Ford's The Witch of Edmonton and the anonymous Arden of Feversham,
      Woodstock, and Sir Thomas More. When modern-day critics write about social relations in this
      period, their usual range of concerns includes hierarchy and power. Personal relationships
      among relative equals are a neglected subject in this field, yet they were central to most
      Elizabethans' lives and world-views. Thus, my reading of these plays focuses on horizontal
      rather than hierarchical social relationships; the key words are not sovereignty, rule,
      obedience but neighborliness, brotherhood, fellowship, community. My central thesis is that
      these texts associate commoners with a specific set of values - mutual help, conviviality,
      conciliation - which grow out of the social structures of village and urban communities to
      become the ideological cornerstone of the English commons. These ideas infuse the political
      rhetoric of stage commoners and inform the ideas about justice, government, and the potential
      for social change that these characters express.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this project, I examine the construction of a new concept of selfishness in
      literary texts of late nineteenth-century England, and it shows that George Eliot advocated
      for an improved understanding of the problems of selfishness and the ways to work through
      them. I examine late nineteenth-century England's failure to recognize its anxiety under the
      post-Adam Smith regime of "enlightened self-interest." I focus on the
      various discourses revolving around the term "selfish" as a way of getting
      at a number of vexed relationships between authors working from outsider positions and
      addressing their own, sometimes undesired, distance. I suggest a broader understanding of the
      ways that artists like Eliot function as critics of their society while simultaneously serving
      as screens for the projection of those same social anxieties which they allow us to theorize.
      And I explain that selfishness, as such, is broadly misunderstood both because it covers so
      much theoretical territory and because interpretations of it have been too limited. Instead of
      using a purely biographical approach, I work mostly through Eliot's fiction not only because
      it is her greatest literary production, but also because the fictional and novelistic forms
      gave her the greatest freedom to showcase embattled selfhood in an unforgiving and
      unsympathetic world. I choose the Scenes of Clerical Life, "The Lifted
      Veil," The Mill on the Floss, and Daniel Deronda as my specific texts for two
      reasons. First, there is the chronological/biographical impulse. The short stories were her
      first attempts at fiction; The Mill on the Floss was an early and admittedly autobiographical
      work; and Daniel Deronda was her last novel. Second, there is the thematic impulse. The short
      stories all pit lone figures against crowds who do not understand them; The Mill on the Floss
      enriches the theme by developing Maggie Tulliver as a tragic heroine who dreams of escaping
      the destiny of "egoism," and Daniel Deronda shows how dedication to the
      right cause or person can move someone from self-preoccupation to something greater.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Correctional education programs in prison increase life and job skills, and reduce
      recidivism. Although these programs are cost-effective and generate positive effects
      post-release, in the last few decades, opposition to correctional education has increased.
      Beginning in the 1970s, critics of rehabilitation programs challenged correctional education,
      particularly the inclusion of postsecondary education in correctional education. Citing high
      recidivism rates, political conservatives attacked the idea of rehabilitation and curtailed
      education programs and funding. Incapacitation emerged as the dominant policy position, and
      emphasis on punishment rather than rehabilitation emerged for the first time in 100 years. In
      the midst of this calamity, an education program in North Carolina thrived. Although
      post-secondary education was rare in state prisons, in North Carolina, a small group of
      committed individuals established a successful program that provided post-secondary education
      to incarcerated youth. The N.C. Department of Corrections implemented theWorkplace and
      Community Transition Youth Offender Program in 1999. The program included college coursework,
      a career counseling course, and a behavior management course. This dissertation research
      represents the educational narratives of participants in that program. Nine students from five
      different correctional facilities across the state participated in a series of in-depth
      interviews. Commitments to postcritical, and experimental ethnography, and feminist
      methodology guided the representations of these students' stories, and narrative analysis and
      narrative theory structured the interpretive work. Findings indicated that for these students,
      positive experiences with school often occurred for the first time in prison.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This work argues the purpose of writing for the female protagonists in Montero's
      Crónica del desamor, La hija del caníbal, La función Delta, Historia del Rey Transparente and
      La loca de la casa. This project attempts to uncover the connection between writing as a
      creative process and all its implications, such as its healing qualities for the protagonists.
      Finally, this study applies the feminist theories of Hélène Cixous, among others, to further
      connect women's personal and societal need to write. The first chapter of this paper includes
      a brief look at the author's life and her many accomplishments, as well as her role in women's
      narrative of post-Franco Spain. This chapter gives special attention to several commonalities
      of the women writers of the time, such as the use of metafiction, the form of writing fiction
      within a fiction, which Montero employs in all five novels. The second chapter encompasses the
      use of writing in order to confront loss. All the protagonists suffer from various losses,
      such as the loss of youth, love and innocence. Chapter three discusses the structure of the
      protagonists' writing within the scope of the novel as a metafiction. In the fourth chapter, I
      expand on the theme of death and how each protagonist uses writing to face their worries about
      dying, and how some of the protagonists employ writing to actually transcend death. Cixous'
      theory encourages women's writing through the body; in correlation with this theory, this
      chapter concentrates on the connection of the ability to procreate through writing. Finally,
      the conclusion illustrates how Montero actually portrays a positive outlook on life through
      the protagonists.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This work will focus on an examination of textual evidence to show that Graciliano
      Ramos's Infância (2006) is the result of the author's long and arduous trajectory as an
      autodidact. That trajectory is represented in a narrative that describes Ramos's process of
      acquiring literacy. In the narrative, there is first a report on the cultural aspects from the
      author's original social environment, in which a process of disruption is triggered and leads
      to a stage of transculturalization. During this stage the author leaves his immediate cultural
      universe to acquire new knowledge and constructs for himself references that are external to
      his familial background, such as the practice of intense reading. To maintain this recently
      developed habit, Graciliano Ramos creates partnerships with individuals who can guide him
      along a path that will take him to other levels in his cultural journey. In Infância, the
      final verification of the author as an autodidact is metaphorically represented by the short
      story "Pequeno pedinte", which is written by the protagonist. The content of
      the story is clearly autobiographical and alludes to a broader literary project in which the
      writer finds meanings for his entire career. The project referred to in the short story is
      Infância itself. Infância is constituted by memories of a past in which the author plays the
      role of the protagonist who learns to read and write and moves from one level of literacy to
      another. To support my discussion of Graciliano Ramos's trajectory as an autodidact who writes
      an autobiographical account, I will first analyze the concept of autobiography in relation to
      Infância e Memórias do cárcere, considered by most critics to be autobiographical. I will then
      study Infância in terms of his literary work in general. The focus will be on the type of
      relationship that Graciliano Ramos's reader may establish with the narratives, whether
      biographical or fictional, and on the way that they can identify the autodidact's features in
      the autobiographer's trajectory. I conclude in this work that the concept of autodidacticism
      can be extended to the individual who has not written an autobiography per se, but who has
      used other forms of narratives, either artistic or not, in prose or in a wide range of oral
      manifestations, such as ballads, songs, popular poetry, "repente", and rap,
      to express an autodidact/ autobiographical model.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study explores psychological distress, parenting behaviors and infant
      temperamental/behavioral risk among rural economically disadvantaged families in which mothers
      and grandmothers are raising an infant together. Traditional components of family stress
      frameworks that model the influence of economic disadvantage on child outcomes via parenting
      were expanded to include factors that may be particularly relevant to these multigenerational
      families of varying maternal age. This study also simultaneously considers the relationship
      between observed mother and grandmother parenting and early child risk. The findings suggest
      that despite the unique risks to psychological well-being faced by grandmothers, the
      grandmothers display higher levels of sensitive parenting. This sensitive parenting is related
      to infant temperamental/behavioral risk in the presence of high levels of maternal negative
      parenting, but only for white families. Mothers and grandmothers display similar levels of
      negative intrusive parenting, but different factors are linked to the observed parenting of
      each generation. These findings contribute to understanding the adaptive benefits and risks of
      three-generation households.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Many cells, including somatic cells, are mortal, they divide a set number of times and
      then senesce or undergo cell death. However, germline and cancer cells have the ability to
      divide indefinitely and are thus considered immortal. In an attempt to better understand how
      cellular immortality is maintained I have been studying the pathways needed to maintain
      germline immortality in the nematode C. elegans. Several genes in various genome stability
      pathways have been identified to be exclusively activated in both cancer and germ cells
      suggesting they are important for cellular immortality. One pathway is the length maintenance
      of telomeres, the ends of chromosomes. Previously, members of the Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 DNA damage
      response complex were identified in C. elegans as being essential not only for germline
      immortality but also telomere maintenance. Based on these findings, two independent forward
      genetic screens were conducted to identify other genes involved in DNA damage response and
      telomere maintenance by first selecting for mutants that are hypersensitive to ionizing
      radiation (which causes double-strand DNA breaks) or resistant to hydroxyurea (which triggers
      S-phase cell cycle arrest) and then for the Mortal Germline phenotype, sterility after
      propagation for multiple generations. One mutant allele, yp4, was isolated as being resistant
      to hydroxyurea and is highly defective for cell cycle arrest in response to both ionizing
      radiation and hydroxyurea. Further characterization of yp4 revealed that it is required for
      germline immortality and displays phenotypes indicative of progressive telomere shortening.
      Additionally, a reverse genetic screen identified hpr-17, which encodes a Rad17 homolog, as
      being the RFC clamp loader that facilitates the Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 complex activity in response to
      DNA damage and in telomerase-mediated telomere replication. Aside from the two genes
      identified to be involved in telomere maintenance, 15 radiation hypersensitive mutants were
      isolated that carry mutations in genes that are essential for germline immortality at 25°C,
      whereas 32 hydroxyurea resistant mutants were isolated that are essential for germline
      immortality at all temperatures. Further analysis of DNA damage response pathways revealed the
      mutants isolated represent a number of genes that play roles in cell cycle arrest and/or
      apoptosis. These mortal germline mutants suggest that at least two DNA damage response
      pathways, independent of telomerase, are required for maintenance of germ cell immortality.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>During a video, each scene element is often imaged many times by the sensor. I propose
      that by combining information from each captured frame throughout the video it is possible to
      enhance the entire video. This concept is the basis of computational video enhancement. In
      this dissertation, the viability of computational video processing is explored in addition to
      presenting applications where this processing method can be leveraged. Spatio-temporal volumes
      are employed as a framework for efficient computational video processing, and I extend them by
      introducing sheared volumes. Shearing provides spatial frame warping for alignment between
      frames, allowing temporally-adjacent samples to be processed using traditional editing and
      filtering approaches. An efficient filter-graph framework is presented to support this
      processing along with a prototype video editing and manipulation tool utilizing that
      framework. To demonstrate the integration of samples from multiple frames, I introduce methods
      for improving poorly exposed low-light videos to achieve improved results. This integration is
      guided by a tone-mapping process to determine spatially-varying optimal exposures and an
      adaptive spatio-temporal filter to integrate the samples. Low-light video enhancement is also
      addressed in the multispectral domain by combining visible and infrared samples. This is
      facilitated by the use of a novel multispectral edge-preserving filter to enhance only the
      visible spectrum video. Finally, the temporal characteristics of videos are altered by a
      computational video resampling process. By resampling the video-rate footage, novel time-lapse
      sequences are found that optimize for user-specified characteristics. Each resulting shorter
      video is a more faithful summary of the original source than a traditional time-lapse video.
      Simultaneously, new synthetic exposures are generated to alter the output video's aliasing
      characteristics.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Interest in teleological analysis has risen dramatically over the last several
      decades: teleo-functional accounts of biological systems, of gross mental state types, and of
      intentionality have all had their share of adherents. Such analysis has been attractive in
      part, because characterizing function as some item's job, office, or role allows that it might
      perform its work more or less well. (For example, in the context of intentionality, the
      possibility of malfunction is what is thought to secure intentional inexistence, e.g.,
      misperception, false belief, etc.) For the application of teleological analysis to traditional
      philosophical problems, such as the "mind/body" problem or the problem of
      "intentional inexistence", to be successful, however, teleo-functional
      ascriptions to natural or nonartifactual systems must be construed literally. Yet, since a
      teleologically characterized item or behavior can succeed or fail at its function,
      teleo-functional ascriptions imply norms or standards of functional performance. A literal
      construal of nonartifactual teleological ascriptions presupposes, then, that there are
      literally norms within the natural world, which are independent of intentional and
      psychological agency. Any realist account of nonartifactual teleology must have at its core a
      realist account of nonartifactual normativity. In short, I develop just such an account of
      normativity and one that will serve as the foundation of nonartifactual teleological realism,
      thereby securing, I believe, a theoretical pillar requisite for naturalizing the mind.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this dissertation, I explore the life stories of sixteen adult mixed race women who
      have one white parent and one parent who is a person of color. I examine how these women
      navigate their hybridity, what we can learn from their stories in our efforts to communicate
      across lines of racial difference, and what experiences the participants share that cross
      racial and ethnic lines. Data sources include multiple individual and group interviews with
      predominately middle-class, educated women living in San Francisco/Oakland, Albuquerque, and
      Boston. I coded the interview transcripts for themes and patterns and situated my analyses in
      relation to discourses of postcolonial hybridity, multiraciality, and social justice. In
      relation to navigating hybridity, the women's experiences reveal an interplay between personal
      agency, claimed through fluid identities, and limitations to social mobility and acceptance
      created by social, cultural, and institutional structures. When asked or compelled to choose,
      all participants chose to align themselves with people of color. I identify several factors
      that contribute to their ability to communicate across lines of racial difference including
      physical ambiguity, learning about multiple world views early in life, keen observation, and
      active listening. Several shared experiences emerged that crossed racial lines. The women in
      my study largely rejected their white identities, experienced their identities in fluid ways
      despite this rejection, claimed the right to self-identify racially/ethnically, and sought
      community with other mixed race people. One of the most significant findings is the degree to
      which many of the participants' stories were dedicated to discussions of cultural whiteness,
      which they viewed as inextricably linked to racism and white supremacy. This work adds to the
      small but growing field of mixed race studies and provides information on improving education
      for social justice. These narratives serve as embodied experiences of hybridity, challenging
      the disembodied postcolonial hybridity theories prevalent in the literature that disregard the
      actual lived experiences of "hybrid"/mixed race people. The stories and
      analysis also reveal ways in which racism and white privilege are enacted on social and
      institutional levels, and raise questions about theories of diversity built on racial
      binaries.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Uruguay and Argentina are two of Latin America's most complete examples of how the
      intersection between print media and collective identities developed. Today visitors to the
      capital cities of Buenos Aires or Montevideo cannot help but notice the deep roots of written
      culture that are visible in the city centers. It is no surprise that these two countries have
      the highest literacy rates in Latin America, which has been the case since the late nineteenth
      century. The intriguing questions are these: How did literacy, written culture, and the clear
      public concern with writing and reading become both so widespread and integral to identity in
      these two nations? What makes the connection between print, the public sphere, and politics in
      the Río de la Plata unique? "From Reading to Reality" addresses these
      questions by providing a panoramic view of the development of Rioplatense print culture from
      the arrival of the first printing presses at the outset of the wars of independence in the
      early 1800s, to the first centenary celebration of independence in 1910. The chapters consider
      a range of print media and how they were received during the three key moments in this story,
      beginning with wartime newspapers and symbolic repertoires where the first attempts were made
      at patriotic poetry, moving to the phenomenon of popular gauchesque newspapers and verse used
      to politicize popular classes at mid-century (a form of popular literature not seen
      elsewhere), and concluding with a detailed look at lessons in patriotism and motherhood
      students learned in textbooks at the turn of the twentieth century. This study underscores how
      print culture in the region became part of daily life for all Uruguayans and Argentines,
      reshaping forms of communication, and how it took root in these two countries more effectively
      than anywhere else in Latin America. It is a 100-year tour that enables the reader to
      understand a unique relationship between print, power, and the public sphere that emerged
      along lines where statesmen and the novels they wrote played only a marginal part.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Environmental stimuli predictive of appetitive events can elicit Pavlovian approach
      responses that enhance an organism’s ability to track and secure natural rewards. We examined
      the activity of individual nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons during the performance of approach
      behaviors. Animals were presented with conditioned stimuli that were either positive (the CS+)
      or negative (the CS-) predictors of reward. Approach responses directed at these cues were
      recorded as lever presses and were significantly more likely to occur during CS+
      presentations. On the test day, 75% of NAc neurons exhibited changes in firing rate (termed
      'phasically active') during CS+ presentations. Of these cells, 47% were characterized by
      time-locked increases in cell firing while 53% showed reductions in firing for the duration of
      the CS+. The same cells typically showed little or no change during CS- presentations. These
      results suggest that NAc neurons encode reward prediction and/or approach responses elicited
      by reward-paired cues.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>A series of reforms transformed the U.S. Army’s tactical and operational doctrine
      between 1970 and 1982. These changes emerged from a confluence of events in the early 1970s
      that marked a renaissance in American military thought. Later debates among key leaders and
      military thinkers continued to propel this intellectual revitalization that ultimately shaped
      the way that the Army would conceptualize future warfare. Thus, it was this conceptual
      “rebirth,” combined with related developments in education and training, that served as a
      turning point for the post-Vietnam American Army. This evolutionary process produced a broader
      conceptualization of doctrine that applied not only to war-fighting, but also to training,
      education, force structure, and weapons acquisition. Above all else, interpersonal dynamics,
      experience, leadership, and historically-inspired thought determined the fate of Active
      Defense, AirLand Battle, and the future of the Army as a whole.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis describes the Louisiana health care system. The literature review is a
      case study of the New Orleans health care sector, previous to and after Hurricane Katrina. The
      review examines criticism of the system, particularly criticisms of the public hospital
      system, the Medicaid disproportionate share hospital reimbursement fund, the low rate of
      insurance coverage among Louisiana residents and the barriers to health care in New Orleans’
      indigent population. The main body of the thesis is a series of journalistic articles. The
      first article is an overview of the system and the proposed “dollar follow the patient”
      reform. The second two articles are narratives, the first based on a provider and the second
      on a patient. The conclusion supports reform of Louisiana’s health care funding and payment
      system, in order to bring health care coverage closer to a universal level, alleviate the
      burden of an under-funded hospital system and create a healthier population in the long term.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this research study was to analyze the Vanderbilt University athletics
      program to determine what motivated the 2003 structural shift, what differences exist between
      the old and new program structure, whether the changes have accomplished the goals set forth
      by Chancellor Gordon Gee, and how they have affected the athletics program. Interviews with
      members of the Vanderbilt University community revealed that Chancellor Gee sought integration
      of athletics into the university when he made changes in 2003, and that there are in fact
      structural differences in the current athletics program administration versus the previous and
      traditional athletics department. No quantitative measure exists to determine a causational
      relationship between the new structure and Vanderbilt’s athletics performance, but subjects
      and data reveal that the changes have not been detrimental to the program. The biggest
      challenge, according to most subjects, is fighting negative perceptions of the revised
      structure.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>According to Dr. Albert Ellis’ Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), our thought
      patterns and self-talk directly influence our behavior and functioning. It is the contention
      of this thesis that adults with Attention Deficit Disorder may benefit from using some of the
      techniques of REBT in order to change habitually unproductive thought and behavior patterns to
      more positive and productive ones. This thesis discusses the impact of Attention Deficit
      Disorder on adults, summarizes the nature of REBT, and shows how using the suggested
      techniques can change both our perception of our individual issues and abilities and the
      reality of our daily lives. A process is suggested whereby each individual dedicates ten
      minutes per day to analyzing a single irrational belief and changing it to a rational one,
      according to the suggested guidelines. A worksheet is provided to help facilitate this
      process.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>After spending nearly ten years working on the project Immediate Family (1984-91),
      Southern photographer Sally Mann (b. 1951) turned her camera to the surrounding lush, bucolic
      and ephemeral Virginia landscape, in a subtle transition she describes as the children slowly
      slipping from the frame, the landscape coming into primary focus. Using her large-format
      vintage camera with damaged lenses, sometimes installed in reverse, Mann employed the
      nineteenth-century wet collodion technique to create atmospheric and haunting images of the
      Virginia, Georgia and Mississipi landscapes in two sequential bodies of work entitled Mother
      Land (1996) and Deep South (1998). Mann’s landscapes examine the uneasy confluence of past and
      present, history and memory, life and death. Through close looking at one image, Untitled
      (Mississippi Landscape), this paper explores the intersection of personal and public memory
      and investigates how photographs have the particular power to function as memorial images.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Between 1863 and 1889, Confederate Major General Daniel Harvey Hill defended himself
      against real and perceived attacks on his reputation in connection with the Lost Dispatch and
      the Battle of Chickamauga, two controversial events of the Civil War. As a crusader of sorts,
      Hill actively shaped the historical memory of the Civil War in part by aggressively pursuing
      personal vindication through correspondence with politicians and colleagues and through
      printed statements in his own and other publications. Hill connected criticism of his military
      reputation with that of his personal reputation, and vice versa. For Hill, these two sides of
      his reputation were intimately linked by the desire to uphold the family name, not only for
      his children, but in relation to his war record and the units he commanded. He was keenly
      aware of his potential role in the memory-making of the war because he was one of its
      architects. Therefore, he consciously made the struggle to clear his reputation part of his
      crusade to sculpt southern and national memory of the Civil War.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Given the attenuating effects of HIV/AIDS on a nation’s working population,
      infrastructure and economy, it is likely that the virus may compromise the unindustrialized
      world’s developmental prospects. Scholarship on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), a well
      supported channel for development, suggests that AIDS would stand as a particular deterrent to
      these inflows, as foreign capital owners have primarily extractive, market, and/or efficiency
      seeking motivations. Thus, nations with a withering labor force, national infrastructure
      and/or markets are unlikely to be attractive investment destinations. Prior investigations of
      FDI’s determinants have focused on structural factors, e.g. regime type, economic status.
      These studies have not considered the role of societal conditions like disease prevalence in
      the investment calculus. This paper addresses the current empirical void, by conducting a
      statistical evaluation of AIDS’ affect on foreign investment inflows. I find strong support
      for my hypothesis that AIDS has a negative impact on attracting FDI.</mods:abstract>

      participation in dominant coalitions by public relations personnel, training, integration and
      expertise, information, effectiveness of communications programs and interaction with other
      coalitions within the organization will be measured. Researching these areas may highlight the
      need for certain changes to Army training and resources for Public Affairs personnel and

               <mods:abstract>In this thesis, I attempt to provide a characterisation of the kind woman, by
      determining what the essential property of the kind is (or whether there even is one), and
      with what kind of necessity it attaches to the kind members. I begin by outlining different
      ways essential properties have been approached in the current philosophical literature. A
      common feature of these views is that they focus on physical structure as essential to kinds
      and kind members. But, I argue, the kind woman cannot be so defined. Instead, the essential
      property of the kind woman should be given in terms of a social (or at least a non-biological)
      property.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study examined parental thoughts about and practices related to their children’s
      language development in Korean-American communities, specifically Korean language schools and
      a Korean church. Forty-three Korean immigrant parents with a U.S.-born child aged 3 to 7
      participated in a survey. The respondents were divided into two groups by their children’s
      dominant language spoken at home: parents with a Korean-dominant child and parents with an
      English-dominant child. Results showed that the two groups of parents have significantly
      different thoughts about their children’s English-language development. In terms of parents’
      reported practices, there were significant differences between the two groups of parents
      concerning their children’s Korean- and English-language development. In addition, the parents
      with a Korean-dominant child were more inclined to value and support their mother tongue’s
      development and showed a positive relationship between their thoughts and reported practices.
      Limitations of the study and implications for parents are discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>State-of-the-art synthesis tools for the design of asynchronous systems rely on
      syntax-driven translation of behavioral specifications. While these tools provide the benefit
      of rapid design, they are severely limited in the performance of their resulting
      implementations (e.g., 10-100 MHz). This research proposes a synthesis approach that builds
      upon the existing state-of-the-art tools, preserving rapid design times and allowing for an
      order of magnitude increase in performance. In particular, this thesis proposes a powerful
      approach to enhance the concurrency of the original behavioral specifications. The proposed
      approach is a “source-to-source” transformation of the original behavioral specification into
      a new behavioral specification using two specific optimizations: automatic parallelization and
      automatic pipelining. The approach has been implemented in an automated design tool and
      applied to a suite of examples for validation. All examples were synthesized to the gate level
      after optimization and compared with the original, non-optimized versions. Results indicate
      improvement in throughput by a factor of up to 23X and a reduction in latency by up to 72%.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this thesis I examine two texts –William Faulkner’s Absalom, Absalom! and Fernando
      Vallejo’s Mi hermano el alcalde– not as they relate to studies of influence, nor the
      categorical imperatives of period studies, but as they relate in and to systems of
      archivization and narration. Within the novels are tropes of many elements of the Archive –the
      Archive as place, authority, and document of the past– that also serve as the structuring
      principle whereby the principle narrators are able to narrate.</mods:abstract>

      data from the years of 1998 through 2004. A successful College Cup was defined as measured
      using the categories of attendance, profit/loss, and television ratings. Within the analysis,
      three variables, weather conditions, proximity of the participating teams, and stadium
      capacity were used to determine the relationship they may or may not have had on the success
      of a College Cup as it was defined. No significant findings presented themselves following the
      analysis, which indicated that no conclusions could be drawn involving the ability of the
      variables to predict the success of the College Cup. However, the limited range of data
      indicated hope that future, more expansive studies, could still uncover significant findings.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Sideline management of a suspected mild head injury includes postural control
      assessments typically performed shortly after exercise. The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the effects of fatigue on postural control in healthy college-aged athletes using
      forceplate measures and the Balance Errors Scoring System (BESS). Post exercise recovery of
      postural control measures were also observed following each exercise protocol at specific time
      intervals. Thirty-six Division I collegiate athletes participated in this study. Statistical
      analysis revealed a significant decrease in postural control assessed immediately after an
      anaerobic and aerobic exercise protocol performed to fatigue (p &lt; 0.001). Postural
      control deficits from fatigue returned to baseline between eight and thirteen minutes
      following each exercise protocol. Administering the BESS immediately following exercise may
      yield falsepositive findings due to the effect from fatigue. Athletic trainers and clinicians
      should be aware of the impact of fatigue on postural control and the fatigue recovery time
      course when determining an appropriate time to administer sideline assessments of postural
      control following a suspected mild head injury.</mods:abstract>

      same rates as men’s athletic programs. The study found that not only were men were given more
      opportunities than women, but the percentage of increase for men was higher than that of
      women. The study also sought to compare women’s opportunities in North Carolina with other

               <mods:abstract>This project analyzes RAFI's current communication methods and provides a plan for its
      communication future. I begin by giving a short overview of RAFI's structure and history to
      provide context to the discussion. Second, I review literature on organizational identity and
      segmenting publics that will illuminate the key role that communication plays in defining an
      organization and helping it connect with stakeholders. Finally, this project develops a public
      relations campaign to create a coherent and compelling way of communicating about the
      organization to stakeholders while working within the time and budget constraints of a small
      organization.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study explored the relationship between baseline client characteristics (i.e.
      age, symptoms, insight, social functioning) and group alliance in 63 outpatients with
      schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Results indicate that a stronger group alliance was
      associated with overall higher levels of group insight. In addition, stronger group alliance
      was significantly correlated with higher attendance rates and therapists’ ratings of treatment
      compliance. These findings have implications for determining group composition and identifying
      clients low in therapeutic engagement. Suggestions for future research on group alliance are
      also discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Witness is the primary form of documenting histories of Fascist violence. Despite the
      inherent problems associated with witnessing, it incorporates itself into purportedly
      objective and scientific histories. Responding to Hayden White’s claim that all histories are
      narrative in structure, my thesis interrogates two artist’s works- W.G. Sebald’s last novel
      Austerlitz and Christian Boltanski’s Resistance. Each project examines the relationships
      between witness, photography and archives, constructing what Boltanski terms “small histories”
      – personal memories, unique to the individual making up an important aspect of their identity,
      falling outside of “objective” histories. Sebald and Boltanski’s narratives become exemplars
      of a literary history, supplementing the gaps within history writing, making “small histories”
      an essential part of historiography. Writing histories of Fascist violence in this way
      counters the ideological and overwhelming images of the Holocaust. Instead their images
      preserve a trace of the individual’s life rather than death, narrating histories that are
      self-reflexive and open.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Physical, cultural, and economic factors have increased Tanzanian women’s
      vulnerability to HIV/AIDS infection. Although health communication campaigns have aimed to
      reduce infection rates and educate people about sexual health topics, little research has been
      done on the effectiveness and suitability of these campaigns in rural areas. Multiple in-depth
      interviews with 20 Tanzanian women from a rural village revealed factors that influenced how
      mass media health messages were perceived and how they fit with local health communication
      networks. Local belief systems and an adherence to male-dominated gender roles might have
      negatively influenced the effectiveness of health messages. Magazines and other mass media,
      though valued, were not seen as adequate replacements for declining traditional,
      community-enforced sexual health communication practices. The women felt that mass media
      messages should be supplemented with seminars and traditional performances and should
      incorporate more technical information about HIV/AIDS, physical pleasure, raising families,
      and other topics.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis examines “the right of the people peaceably to assemble” and its gradual
      disappearance from American constitutional jurisprudence. I begin by exploring the English and
      colonial roots of the freedom of assembly and its adoption in the Bill of Rights. In doing so,
      I highlight the significance of political and religious assembly to the Framers and in the
      early Republic. I then examine the development of assembly in American constitutional law and
      the later emergence of the right of association in the context of mid-twentieth century
      liberalism. I argue throughout the thesis that assembly, unlike association, reminds us of the
      importance of protecting the physical act of people coming together, the value of allowing
      dissent, and the fundamental differences between state and non-state social practices. I
      conclude by positing how a recovery of the freedom of assembly might be employed within a
      contemporary legal framework to strengthen the constitutional protections for groups.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>According to some theorists, the incest taboo is the basis for the formation of all
      society, and the family unit is the basic structure of power in which the incest taboo is
      enforced. Ironically, in Elfriede Jelinek’s Die Ausgesperrten, the protagonist, who is on the
      verge of becoming an adult, is forced to murder his entire family because it stands in the way
      of his accepting the incest taboo. Needless to say, there are severe problems in his family
      and in his society and these problems place him in this contradiction. Using Freud’s theory of
      the Oedipus Complex. I will reveal the nature of the bourgeois family structure and of society
      in 1950s Austria as disastrous for the incest taboo and, with it, for the fundamentals of
      society. I will also reveal how the eradication of the family structure allows hope for
      progress.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study investigated the relationship between insulin resistance
      (HOMA-IR&gt;4.0) and six adiposity surrogates in children and adolescents: body mass index
      (BMI), BMI percentiles (BMI %), sum of skinfolds (SSF), waist circumference (WC), WC
      percentiles (WC %), and waist circumference to height ratio (WHtR). Step-wise multiple
      regression models for HOMA-IR, including age, sex, and ethnicity, found that SSF was the
      strongest surrogate for predicting insulin resistance (r2=0.298) with little influence from
      age, sex, and ethnicity. The weakest predictor was BMI % (r2=0.148) and was significantly
      influenced by age, sex, and ethnicity. Odds ratios were determined for risk of developing
      insulin resistance. These were highest for SSF compared to the other surrogates, with SSF
      &gt;28 mm, increasing the risk of insulin resistance 9.2 times (CI=7.0-11.9). Thus, SSF
      appears to be the most independent surrogate to predict insulin resistance and BMI % the least
      independent surrogate.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Wings of Desire engages in a dialectic of remembering and forgetting by presenting the
      inner dialogues and memories of the people of Berlin in the foreground of a physical memory of
      destruction. The inhabitants wander the city with little attentiveness to its architecture
      (the Berlin wall and the ruined buildings as a record of jarred collective memory) while being
      absorbed in their own troubled thoughts, but Wenders reconciles this disconnect in the figure
      of the storyteller. The film explores the intricacies of memory through notions of
      storytelling, often reflecting Benjamin’s theories of memory and history. My paper extensively
      analyzes these concepts as they are portrayed in the postmodern metropolis of Berlin,
      identifying not only the problems that arise in the attempt to depict a postmodern narrative
      but also the ways in which Wenders is able to resolve these problems and leave his viewers
      with optimism and hope for the future.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis begins from the assumption that there are inherent tensions within
      contemporary democratic citizenship that cause intractable conflicts between citizens over
      political policies. These conflicts are often caused by a lack of understanding of each
      other’s positions as well as a lack of concern for the common good. The thesis will attempt to
      defend one central argument: that a rich description of the actual physical political spaces
      in which political and ethical commitments are formed helps to provide us with both a clearer
      picture of the limitations and highest potentials of contemporary citizenship. To demonstrate
      this point, the study critically considers the work of Alasdair MacIntyre, Romand Coles, and
      Jeffrey Stout, describing and evaluating their distinctive conceptions of political space.
      While the work underlines the importance of examining physical political space when studying
      citizenship, it also points towards a new, more hopeful vision for democratic citizenship
      itself.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Labor unions are in an important time of change. As memberships decline, a new
      organization, called Change to Win, has broken from the AFL-CIO in an attempt to organize new
      members. This thesis follows this new push to unionize more workplaces. It also examines the
      legal barriers that thwart organizing drives and new attempts to reform those laws. Finally,
      it describes the internal battle over forging a cohesive immigration policy. The goal is to
      explore the new surge in organizing, while also recognizing the internal and external problems
      that still plague the American union movement.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper explores the challenges that the pregnant subject poses to a liberal
      conception of the self that presupposes rationality as a fundamental element of personhood
      without considering corporeality. I contend that such challenges must be taken seriously by
      liberals who assume a rational individualist model of human beings and then build upon such a
      conception self in order to emphasize or develop a particular set of core principles by which
      we ought to live. More importantly, these challenges ought to be taken seriously by feminists
      who have relied primarily on a woman’s capacity for rationality and autonomy to advance
      theories of justice. Finally, this paper addresses ethics of care theorists who have
      challenged liberalism but have failed to ground their theories in a conception of “normal”
      personhood as constituted by both rationality and corporeality.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In the Synopsis of Meditations on First Philosophy Descartes claims that he will
      develop a clear and distinct perception of extension “partly in the Second Meditation, and
      partly in the Fifth and Sixth Meditations (CSM II p. 9).” Unfortunately, many commentators
      completely ignore this explicit declaration of Descartes’s goal of developing a clear and
      distinct perception of extension over the course of the three aforementioned Meditations. This
      leads to serious interpretive errors. In this thesis I argue that it is important to take
      Descartes at his word in the Synopsis. I also argue that doing so requires one to adopt a
      particular interpretive approach, which I contend is preferable to the alternatives. Finally,
      I offer a model for understanding Descartes’s development of an enduring, indubitable clear
      and distinct perception of extension in the Meditations.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the attitudes of consumers towards
      viral marketing. In-depth interviews with college undergraduates were used to explore the
      motivation to share content, specifically, videos found on YouTube.com. Four themes emerged
      from the analysis. First, several factors functioning as filters in the decision to forward
      content are identified. Second, humor and personalization are identified as major factors in
      this process. Third, the perception of advertising as entertainment is discussed. Finally the
      extent to which content is new is found to be a major factor. The significance of these
      findings is two-fold. Each theme affects the likelihood that content will be forwarded. More
      importantly, the findings uncover the motivation to share content altogether, conforming to
      the theory of social capital, in which information is used to establish social status.
      Ultimately, these findings further the practical and theoretical understanding of viral
      marketing.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The current thesis focuses on The Equivalence between Giving and Receiving (Al-Taswiya
      bayna al-Ifada wa-l-Qabul), an unpublished Arabic treatise written by Muhibb Allah Ilahabadi
      (d .1648), known in India as “the second Ibn Arabi.” Although this text is one of the most
      controversial interpretations of Ibn Arabi’s metaphysics written in India, it and its author
      are rarely mentioned in contemporary scholarship on Sufism. I will argue that The Equivalence
      evinces a deeply Avicennan Neoplatonic idiom that is distinct from Ibn Arabi’s synthesis,
      which serves as its wider framework. The text thereby demonstrates an innovative integration
      of philosophical traditions within the larger context of Ibn Arabi’s school in seventeenth
      century India, showing that Muhibb Allah's unique philosophical synthesis is in conversation
      with his diverse intellectual milieu. The Equivalence reveals a dynamic philosophical
      discourse among intellectual communities of seventeenth century South Asia.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Two streams of literature portray waiting tables as either transitional or dead-end.
      The flexibility of serving jobs enables students to combine work and school, yet the lack of
      mobility opportunities means most movement is lateral, from one service occupation to another.
      Using matched CPS data, this paper employs logistic regression to analyze movement out of
      serving and into another service occupation, an unrelated occupation, or unemployment. While
      gender is related to lateral mobility, it fails to predict movement into unrelated occupations
      or unemployment. Education, conversely, has little influence on lateral mobility, but
      influences movement into unrelated occupations or unemployment.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this thesis, I argue that Christian Kracht’s novel Faserland is a paradigmatic
      representation of the quandary of postmodernity facing Germany. I discuss the transition from
      modernity to postmodernity as it is manifested in this novel as a flattening or homogenization
      of the vertically-oriented, individuating concept of a Marcusean critical modernity. The
      transition is marked by a semiotic paradigm shift from the Marcusean construct of the Machine
      to what I refer to as the “Blue-Screen.” The central problem underlying this change is how
      Germany as a society is to adapt to postmodernity and its eradication of identity and
      individuality. While the behavior of the novel’s protagonist offers a potential coping
      mechanism in line with Félix Guattari’s concept of “Machinic Doping,” it is a solution that
      Germany is unable to utilize, as the postmodern implication of severing ties to the past is
      something that the nation cannot accept.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This work traces the development of a new, female-friendly courtly model in Hartmann
      von Aue’s Erec through a close examination of the development of female subjectivity. I argue
      that female subjectivity is affirmatively realized in Erec through a succession of private and
      semi-private spaces, whose physical and/or metaphorical placement outside the purview of
      theretofore understood methods of gauging the acceptability of feminine behavior, promotes a
      simultaneously separate and equal role for courtly ruling women.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The development of conservation policy for rare plant species is informed by
      largescale patterns of distribution and abundance as well as the processes that generate them.
      I collected data on 224 rare vascular plants in the Southeastern U.S. to characterize patterns
      of rarity at ecoregional scales, among broad habitat types, and with respect to taxonomic
      group size. Rare species diversity is highest in Appalachian/Blue Ridge Forests and
      Southeastern Conifer Forests ecoregions. Most rare plants are concentrated in woodland and
      glade habitats and larger taxonomic groups. A case-study experimental approach was adopted to
      explore the significance of reproductive biology in the persistence of a globally imperiled
      Southeastern endemic plant, Ptilimnium nodosum. The species has a phenologically regulated
      mixed mating system dependent on insect-mediated pollination. Moderate reproductive output and
      high seed germinability suggest environmental conditions, not mating system, play a critical
      role in regulating the species’ distribution and abundance, and favor high immediate fitness
      gained by vegetative reproduction.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In April of 1870, Machado de Assis was invited to translate Charles Dickens’ first
      novel into Portuguese. The important task of introducing the celebrated Oliver Twist and his
      creator to a Brazilian audience was conferred upon Machado solely on his merits as a rising
      intellectual voice in Brazilian letters. Machado’s idiosyncrasies as a translator range from a
      cavalier treatment of details, to what seem to be ideologically motivated narrative omissions.
      His procedures in these early years as a translator of Dickens are instrumental in the
      formation of his political and social consciousness as a mature novelist. I propose to trace
      in these early years not only the genesis of an elusive literary social political that would
      permeate his later novels and cause him much critique by his peers, but also to demonstrate
      the undeniable influence that such a close relationship with the British Victorian would have
      on the Brazilian Romantic.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Hip-hop in the Mississippi Delta is defined by the interaction of Diasporic aesthetic
      practice, local cultural tradition and global networks. Through collaborative ethnographic
      work with Delta hip-hop artists and the community that surrounds them, I explore the ways in
      which these forces influence the form and function of expressive culture in the area. Because
      the music of the region has been a site of intensive ethnographic collection for over a
      century, I will draw from scholarship on traditional Delta music to demonstrate its
      relationship to contemporary styles. Today, the freestyle hip-hop artist has taken on the
      prominent role once reserved for the bluesman. Rather than representing a break with the blues
      tradition, Delta hip-hop carries on many of the stylistic traits, performance techniques and
      functions of the blues. In its relationship to the blues, Delta freestyle hip-hop demonstrates
      the dynamic nature of Afrodiasporic folklore.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Jean Sibelius’s compositions, like those of many artists in the nineteenth and early
      twentieth centuries, became inseparable from discourses of aesthetics and politics. The 1895
      Lemminkäinen Suite (Op. 22, no. 1–4) is a work often associated with such trends: the
      four-movement tone poem is based on the Kalevala, a Finnish epic poem intimately tied to
      artistic and nationalist sentiments in Finland. Situating the Suite within the
      aesthetic/political movement known as Karelianism and parallel to the Kalevala as literature,
      I explore the musical gestures Sibelius employs that create a musical narrative reflecting its
      poetic source in subject, form, and mode. In analyzing the Suite’s uniquely “epic” nature, I
      approach the musical narrative semiologically by examining musical “topoi” within their larger
      formal settings. I conclude my narratological examination by focusing on musical time in the
      work, an element that, in encouraging a perception of expansive temporality, plays an
      important role in the construction of the musical epic.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Meticulously restored by Italian archaeologists in the 1930s, the Roman theater at
      Sabratha in Libya is today one of the most impressive Roman monuments in North Africa. The
      Sabratha theater is distinctive for its sculptured pulpitum, which is decorated with a variety
      of mythological, historical, and genre scenes. This paper examines the sculptural decoration
      of the theater within the historical and social context of the development of Sabratha,
      examining both the style and content of the program of decoration. The application of
      ‘Romanization’ in Sabratha will be examined in view of the sculptural decoration as material
      evidence of the presence and effects of Empire on the provincial city. The Sabratha reliefs
      and the theater building originally functioned in part to form the face of Sabratha as a
      ‘Roman’ city.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Translation has been a part of Latin literature since its beginning with the Odusia of
      Livius Andronicus. Throughout the late Roman Republic literary translators – those translators
      who aim at creating innovative pieces of literature rather than following their source texts
      verbatim – develop their art and a variety of techniques for appropriating Greek poetry. This
      study shows that each Latin literary translator draws on their predecessors and finds unique
      solutions to their individual problems. It demonstrates that each translator also adapts their
      source texts in different ways according to their periods, genres, styles, and purposes. It
      looks at the ancient terminology, theory, and practice of translation and shows that, while
      there is no consistent vocabulary or system of translation in Rome, literary translation is
      nevertheless highly-developed and subtle throughout the Republic. It examines the translations
      of the Preneoteric translators Quintus Lutatius Catulus and Gnaeus Matius, Cicero and Varro
      Atacinus, and Catullus.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This investigation considers how African American adolescents shift their speech
      styles based on context by examining the speech of 50 sixth-graders. It assesses the use of
      African American English structures in formal and informal peer contexts to determine which
      features are affected by the situation. The results reveal shifts in the overall inventory of
      structures, indicating that adolescents have a growing awareness of the role of situational
      context in adjusting their speech. Analyses also suggest that not all dialect features are
      implicated in shifting; thus, a revised inventory of features is proposed to quantify style
      shift. The goal was to arrive at a minimally adequate subset of features that effectively
      assesses speakers’ overall vernacular use as well as their shifting behavior across contexts.
      This subset measure is compared to other “all-encompassing” measures and the advantages and
      disadvantages of both methodologies are discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Thomas Frank's What's the Matter with Kansas argues that social issues have become
      more important to lower income voters than economic issues, leading to a greater probability
      for them to vote against their own economic interests by voting for conservative candidates.
      This paper takes his much disputed theory and applies it to the Republican primary elections
      rather than general elections. Scholars have documented the presence of a conservative
      Republican wing associated with the religious right and a more moderate wing which emphasizes
      social issues less and distances itself from the religious right. My analysis connects this
      elite level dynamic to mass political behavior through an examination of county level election
      returns in presidential primaries from 1976 through 2000. When candidates from the two wings
      engage in a competitive national primary a pattern emerges that shows different demographic
      sources of support for the two factions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>President Jimmy Carter became commander-in-chief at an important juncture in American
      civil-military relations. This study adds to the largely neglected historiography of
      civil-military relations during the Carter years by examining the administration’s first two
      years, using the civil-military dialogue surrounding the fiscal year 1978 and fiscal year 1979
      defense budgets as its primary category of analysis. The study demonstrates that growing
      cooperation within the Pentagon, increasing conflict between the Pentagon and the White House,
      and a strengthening military-congressional alliance best characterized civil-military
      relations in the first two years of the Carter administration. This pattern of civil-military
      relations prevailed primarily due to early and intense presidential involvement in the defense
      budgetary process and because of the administration’s attempts to re-prioritize defense
      spending. The culmination of this pattern of civil-military relations in the administration’s
      first two years was the presidential veto of the fiscal year 1979 defense appropriations bill.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The effects of partner support on women with breast cancer were investigated utilizing
      a daily diary methodology. Fifty-four women who had recently been diagnosed with early-stage
      breast cancer completed daily diary measures of partner support amount and satisfaction, mood,
      cancer symptoms, and role functioning each day for 30 days. Results indicate that the
      relationship between support amount and satisfaction and the various outcomes differs
      depending on the level of support, suggesting different underlying mechanisms for average,
      same-day, and previous-day support. Women’s average amount and satisfaction with support may
      help protect the women from the negative impact of breast cancer, while a woman’s daily
      fluctuations in support seem to be related to her experience on that specific day. For
      previous-day support, amount appears to operate in the expected direction, while the effect of
      satisfaction is unclear. Thus, amount and satisfaction are both important when investigating
      effects of partner support.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Studies investigating the effect of interdependence on conflict have produced
      contradictory empirical findings. Studies using datasets from the mid-19th century onward have
      found that increasing levels of trade between nations increase the likelihood of peace.
      Studies incorporating a longer time-frame have suggested the opposite. I theorize that the
      effect of interdependence on war is a result of the level of interconnectedness in a system of
      trading countries. I test the theory using a computational model which places countries in a
      randomly configured system. As time passes, transportation technology increases and the effect
      of various levels of interdependence on war is observed. The patterns of warfare which emerge
      from the computational model suggest that transportation technology had a variable effect in
      determining if countries go to war.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study examined two peer relations concepts that may be relevant for understanding
      weight-related behaviors in adolescents: socialization and popularity. Data from 582 youth in
      grades 6-8 at an initial time point were used to examine best friend and friendship group
      socialization of weight-related behaviors, as well as the reciprocal effects of popularity on
      weight-related behaviors. Measures were administered at two time points and included
      self-report indices of body dissatisfaction, body-related cognitions, and dieting practices.
      Sociometric assessments were conducted to examine friendships and two forms of popularity
      (i.e., preference- and reputation-based). Results suggested that both best friend and
      friendship group socialization were important predictors of body dissatisfaction,
      muscle-gaining behaviors, and diet-based exercise, and that gender moderated these processes.
      Popularity was both an outcome and predictor of weight-related behaviors, and moderated best
      friend socialization of diet-based exercise. Overall, results were modest and suggest complex
      processes in peer socialization of weight-related behaviors.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper focuses on the representation of prisoner functionaries in the traditional
      historiography. Starting with Eugen Kogon, it traces the development of the “good political”
      versus “bad criminal.” Using prisoner and prisoner functionary testimonies, it demonstrates
      that this current representation is too simplistic and must be re-evaluated. Prisoner
      functionaries were both prisoners and functionaries, and wore a Janus face at all times. This
      meant they hurt some as they saved others- all within the confines of their limited power. The
      paper ends with Primo Levi’s The Gray Zone and a call for the understanding to be applied to
      future works on prisoner functionaries.</mods:abstract>

      load and visual STM for two types of items, abstract and meaningful, as well as determine the
      impact of item type and information load on age-related reductions in STM. Two experiments
      tested the hypotheses that age differences are greater in visual search and visual short-term
      memory for abstract items, and that information load may not fully explain age differences in
      visual STM. Age differences in visual search were greater for abstract than meaningful items,
      but older adults showed equivalent age-related reductions in visual STM for the two classes.
      Information load was a better predictor of visual STM capacity than item type when we compared
      the two classes.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis explores the nature and authority of the theological comments made by
      Xenophanes of Colophon. In my first chapter I discuss the critical and positive fragments of
      Xenophanes’ work and attempt to both construct a consistent theological account and discover
      the methods by which he arrives at his conclusions. After adopting James Lesher’s position
      that Xenophanes is rejecting the possibility of divine communication, I explore the
      consequences of this radical pronouncement in my second chapter: if Xenophanes, unlike his
      poetic predecessors, does not have access to the gods through divine inspiration, how can he
      speak authoritatively about divine matters? In this chapter I begin by discussing the gods,
      truth, and authority in the works of Homer and Hesiod before analyzing these concepts in the
      fragments of Xenophanes. In my third chapter I attempt to pinpoint the significance of
      Xenophanes’ position by comparing his thoughts with those of two (roughly) contemporary poets,
      Parmenides and Pindar.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Although previous scholarship has suggested settlement patterns for the middle
      Volturno valley, these patterns do not take into account all of the evidence that is currently
      available. Also, the models of settlement patterns that have previously been applied to this
      region seem to have been based on the assumption that this region functions in the same way as
      areas that have city-state organization. This study takes a closer look at the sites of the
      middle Volturno valley, including settlements, sanctuaries, and other associated sites, in
      order to develop a more accurate settlement pattern for this region. It refutes the assumption
      that this region employed territorial boundary sanctuaries, and suggests instead that the
      settlement pattern here was a complex one that employed sanctuaries to serve as areas for
      cultural interfacing rather than as symbols of territorial demarcation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper explores the relationship between democratic opening and contentious
      politics. It focuses on one element of contentious politics, tactics, which are expected to
      change substantially alongside the move from an authoritarian to a democratic regime. Although
      the theories on tactical shifts in response to regime change were crafted in light of the
      early European experience with democratization, this paper shows that the theory holds in the
      radically different context of Mexico between 1964 and 2000. Tactics shifted from
      predominantly direct to demonstrative forms of action with the political opening that occurred
      during this period. As the political regime opened, even rural protesters shifted to a heavier
      reliance on demonstrative tactics. This paper also illustrates that full democratization is
      not required to precipitate the shift in tactics. During Mexico’s hybrid regime, from 1988 to
      2000, popular mobilization took on democratic rather than authoritarian characteristics.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>While intercollegiate athletics has maintained a very unique relationship with
      academic institutions, financial growth of college athletics within the past decade has led to
      staunch criticism regarding the academic integrity of the inclusion of a commercial enterprise
      within the higher education model. The purpose of this study was to analyze whether
      intercollegiate athletics support the academic mission of higher education. Specifically, this
      study extended previous empirical research and examined the relationship between football
      success over a period of time and overall graduation rates at Division I-A institutions
      (McCormick &amp; Tinsley, 2002; Tucker, 1992; Tucker 2004). This study identified relevant
      academic and football success variables that were significantly related to graduation rates.
      Combining the academic and football success variables, the study determined a model of
      explanatory variables that best predicted graduation rates. The findings of a positive and
      significant relationship between football success and graduation rates supports the theory
      that athletics support an institution’s educational mission and encourage the assimilation of
      students to collegiate life.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Beginning with the Action Council for the Liberation of Woman and their Store Front
      Daycare initiative in 1968 and then progressing through the diverse movement of the 1970s,
      this paper analyzes the debates over the gendered division of labor, the meanings of work, the
      “children’s question”– how could children be brought up in an “anti-authoritarian” manner, and
      the “mother question”- how could mothers balance childcare and public participation, in the
      West German New Women’s Movement. Responding to structural, cultural, and social changes in
      the everyday lives of women in postwar society, these debates reflected the diversity of the
      movement and their various attempts to find a concrete theory of emancipation and feminist
      strategy. Without an analysis of these debates and constructions of feminist strategy and
      theory, we cannot begin to understand the activities and praxis of the movement, nor begin to
      understand the affects of the movement on West German society.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study examined the remuneration of intercollegiate athletics coaches at state
      institutions in North Carolina within the context of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA) and Title
      VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII). The study analyzed the salaries of men’s and
      women’s basketball coaches and men’s and women’s soccer coaches at the fifteen state
      institutions in the University of North Carolina system. The purpose of this study was to
      determine if gender is a noteworthy factor in the comparatively lower remuneration of female
      coaches when compared to male coaches. This study found some important differences in salary
      across gender bounds, some of which are easily justified by legally recognized factors while
      some other differences are defensible only through inconsistencies in interpretation and
      application of the law. The study also found that the subject institutions were far closer to
      equitable salary distribution than the national averages.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>A randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine the effectiveness of
      Adherence-Coping-Education (ACE) Therapy. Twenty-four individuals were randomized to receive
      14 sessions of either ACE therapy in addition to treatment as usual (TAU), or Supportive
      Therapy (ST) in addition to TAU. Participants were assessed on measures of medication
      attitudes, insight, symptoms, and social functioning. ACE therapy was well tolerated, with
      comparable attrition rates between the two interventions and high therapy attendance. ACE
      Therapy was associated with significant improvements in medication attitudes as well as
      psychotic symptoms, insight and functioning. A greater proportion of individuals in the ACE
      condition had clinically significant change on positive symptom scores than did those in the
      ST condition. These results lend initial support for the feasibility of ACE Therapy, and
      suggest that it may facilitate recovery from an initial psychotic episode. Findings are
      discussed within the context of the study’s limitations.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Nietzsche’s five lectures titled Ueber die Zukunft unserer Bildungsanstalten given in
      1872 show similarities of form and content to Plato’s Republic. They are written as a
      continuous dialog between an aged philosopher and a group of younger interlocutors. They also
      argue for the necessity of a caste system, an educational system centered on a rigorous ascent
      through disciplines until one achieves communion with the metaphysical absolute, and other
      elements found in the Republic. This comparison of the lectures to the Republic examines the
      early Nietzsche’s relation to Plato’s theory of education and his metaphysics in order to draw
      out Nietzsche’s dependence on and variance with Platonism and to understand what value he
      places on the study of the Greeks. In the course of the comparison Nietzsche’s ambivalent
      relationships to German classicism, philological historicism, German nationalism, and German
      philosophy are also discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Film About a Woman Who…, is the second feature length film made from 1972 to 1974 by
      Yvonne Rainer. Rainer juxtaposes images, texts, narrative and music and intermingles them in
      her filmic space, which confuses and frustrates the viewer who is accustomed to the linear
      narratives of most films. Most critics generally categorize the film within the avant-garde
      feminist film movement due to its experimental film form and social metaphors. But rather than
      addressing mainstream gender-specific discourses, this paper places the film in the context of
      Roland Barthes’s notion of pleasure/bliss, the neutre, and readerly/writerly reading to
      explain viewers’ free and individual identification. Furthermore, it explores and analyzes the
      meaning of both cliché and anticliché, and of the temporal dialectics in re-presenting
      autographical diaries.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Scholars typically think of the United States as an example of civic nationalism, a
      relatively inclusive nation that is held together by a shared commitment to the civic
      principles of freedom, equality and toleration. I argue to the contrary, that the American
      nation is a culturally particular nation whose citizens must conform to more than belief in
      those principles. To make this case, I examine the process by which non-Americans are
      assimilated and educated for citizenship, reviewing citizenship education materials— manuals,
      handbooks and textbooks—from three periods of particularly intense nationalism from the early
      twentieth century to today. Through this review, I show that citizenship in the United States
      has historically meant assuming a much more comprehensive identity than the one a civic
      nationalist account of the American nation might suggest.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Using the mythic Yoruba trickster figure Eshu-legba as a cultural and theoretical
      guide, I explore two sites of Western identity-play: the phone booth of the superhero icon
      Superman and the performance stage. This project probes my original script and live
      production, Authentic Chameleons, which incorporated an adaptation of a Yoruba myth and
      further extended my research through performance. The topics explored include: the embodiment
      of mutable identities as a theatrical tradition, the place of multiplicity in cultural
      performances, and the relationship between performance and identity. Analysis of the
      production functions to reformulate identity and reconfigure the cultural frameworks that
      allow for embodied ambivalence and plurality.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Objective: To evaluate the relationships between sagittal plane knee, hip, and trunk
      angles with peak anterior tibial shear force (ATSF) during a jump-landing task. Subjects:
      Thirty-three healthy female recreational athletes with no prior history of anterior cruciate
      ligament (ACL) injury volunteered to participate in this study. Measurements: Knee, hip, and
      trunk kinematic data were collected with an electromagnetic motion capture system during a
      jump-landing task. Within- and between-subject data were analyzed using correlation and
      multiple regression statistical analyses. Results: Knee flexion angle at peak ATSF was found
      to be significantly correlated with peak ATSF (p=0.021, r = -0.367). Additionally, trunk
      flexion (world) at peak ATSF was found to have a significant positive relationship with peak
      ATSF (p=0.046, r =0.309). Knee flexion angle at peak ATSF was found to predict approximately
      13.5% of the variance in ATSF (p=.042, R2=.135). Multiple within-subject correlations and
      regressions were found, however they varied amongst all angles between subjects. Conclusion:
      Knee flexion angles appear to predict ATSF in female athletes. While hip and trunk flexion
      angles did not predict ATSF in this study, training should emphasize increased flexion at all
      three joints in order to decrease ACL injury. Sagittal plane joint angles did not explain all
      the variability in peak ATSF, therefore other factors need to be examined.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Cancer treatments cause numerous side effects that can last years post-treatment.
      Fatigue is the most common side-effect and can lead to a reduction in patients’ functionality
      and overall quality of life. The purpose of this study was to evaluate physical activity
      levels (IPAQ), selected physiological and psychological parameters on breast cancer survivors
      prior to staring an exercise/recreation therapy program. A secondary purpose explored
      relationships between the IPAQ and all psychological and physiological parameters evaluated.
      Sixteen female breast cancer patients participated in the study. Results found a significant
      positive relationship between physical activity levels and overall fatigue (P=0.039). A
      multiple regression analyses showed that depression accounted for the greatest amount of
      variance in both fatigue and quality of life (P=0.012 and 0.000). Knowing the multidimensional
      impact of cancer on overall fatigue and quality of life, the management of depression becomes
      critical in improving the patient’s well being and overall health.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>ADCPs have been used to measure Reynolds stresses in tidally dominated environments
      where wave action was minimal. In this thesis we examine observations from a microtidal
      estuary where the effects of wind stress and surface waves dominate the velocity variance.
      Reynolds stress measurements in this setting require a technique for addressing surface
      gravity wave contamination. We present here a method of reducing the effect of wave motion on
      Reynolds stresses by subtracting coincident observations along the axis of the ADCP beam.
      Linear wave theory is used to account for the attenuation of wave orbital velocities with
      depth. Using this method, Reynolds stress values are brought in line with those predicted by
      drag laws at the surface and bottom. Coincident density profile measurements are used with the
      ADCP data to compute gradient Richardson numbers throughout the water column. Enhanced
      Reynolds stresses appear to correspond to Richardson numbers less than one.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Late eighteenth-century French and Italian culture reflected an obsession with love
      and relationships through literature, music, and other art forms. Seduction scenes are one
      type of commentary on relationships that dot the landscape of opera of the time. The operatic
      seduction scene involves not only the two characters on stage but also a third agent – the
      music. After situating operatic seduction in the broader context of late eighteenth-century
      French and Italian culture, this thesis outlines the specific musical vocabulary of seduction
      that was put to use by composers, enacted on stage, and understood by audiences. This
      vocabulary is then applied to several case studies in the music of Mozart, who is now viewed
      as the dominant opera composer of the time, and his contemporaries. Through creative
      application and manipulation of the musical language of seduction, composers create ambiguous
      situations and invest the music with dramatic agency, allowing it to support, subvert, or
      otherwise comment on the seduction occurring on stage.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine student athletes’ and non-athletes’ academic
      performance within the criterion of being a transfer or non-transfer student at a Division I-A
      institution. Data was collected on a total of 2,740 students, through submission from the
      University of North Carolina’s Institutional Research Department. Measurements of academic
      success were analyzed by using one-sample t-test, independent t-test, and descriptive
      statistics. Results indicated significant differences among all four comparisons (1.
      non-transfer non-student-athletes v. non-transfer studentathletes; 2. transfer
      non-student-athletes v. transfer student-athletes; 3. non-transfer nonstudent-athletes v.
      transfer non-student-athletes; 4. non-transfer student-athletes v. transfer student-athletes).
      Non-student-athletes were found to have the greatest academic success. Of the
      non-student-athletes, non-transfer non-student-athletes reached a higher level of academic
      success than transfer non-student-athletes. Transfer-student-athletes showed to have a higher
      probability of gaining more academic success than non-transfer student-athletes, but were
      generally out-performed by transfer non-student-athletes. When excluding transferring from the
      equation, non-transfer non-student-athletes’ academic success surpassed non-transfer
      student-athletes. Data from this study will hopefully provide a foundation to lead into
      additional research examining if the NCAA transfer rule is too restrictive or lenient.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In 1978, the European disco group Boney M made history when they performed a series of
      ten concerts in Moscow as the guests of the Soviet government, the first Western popular music
      group to receive such an invitation. Yet despite breaking through the Iron Curtain, Boney M
      could not avoid the censorship of the Communist government. One of their biggest hits in
      Russia at that time, “Rasputin,” —a humorous portrait of the infamous monk who was an aide to
      the Tsar in the early twentieth century— circulated throughout Russia in bootleg copies.
      Because Boney M utilized musical signifiers of “Russianness” along with tongue-in-cheek lyrics
      about a Russian historical figure, the Soviet government deemed the song unacceptable for
      performance or release. Close musical analysis coupled with a critical examination of the
      Russian reception of “Rasputin” reveals a confluence of musical signification, exoticism, and
      the relationship of music and politics.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Constructive empiricism, the scientific anti-realism championed by Bas van Fraassen,
      claims to offer an adequate reconstruction of the aim and practice of scientific inquiry
      without adopting the inflationary metaphysical excesses of scientific realism. In articulating
      the positions of the realist and the empiricist, van Fraassen freely makes use of the concept
      of truth. Theories of truth come in a variety of flavors, some more metaphysically stark than
      others. Deflationary theories of truth, for instance, boast of the ability to offer a full
      account of the nature of truth without having to succumb to the supposed metaphysical
      extravagances accompanying more substantive accounts. Constructive empiricism and deflationism
      about truth seem, then, to form a natural pair. My contention is that such a pairing is not
      possible—constructive empiricism requires a more substantive account of truth than can be
      offered by the deflationist.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>How did ordinary German soldiers confront atrocities and their complicity in them?
      This study investigates the complexities of participation and non-participation in spontaneous
      acts of violence in one unit on the eastern Front. It begins by examining what kinds of
      propaganda soldiers were exposed to and what kinds of beliefs and worldviews they expressed in
      letters home. In September 1942, the 4th Panzer Signal company murdered thirty to forty Jews
      in the tiny Soviet town of Peregruznoje, apparently on the initiative of the unit commander. A
      case study of this unit illuminates a twisted terrain of choices, pressures, norms, and
      organizational culture that helps explain why some men (and units) killed and others did not.
      This work argues that the kinds of “perpetrators” among Wehrmacht soldiers fall along a
      continuum of response: an activist core led by the commander, followers who went along, and
      others who evaded participation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Objective: To evaluate relationships between Anterior Tibial Shear Force (ATSF) and
      eccentric quadriceps strength (QuadEcc), concentric hamstring strength (HamCon), and the
      QuadEcc/HamCon ratio. Design: Correlational. Setting: Research laboratory. Participants:
      Thirty-three healthy female recreational athletes. Main Outcome Measure(s): ATSF was measured
      during a landing task via inverse dynamics. QuadEcc and HamCon were assessed at 60°/s, 180°/s,
      and 300°/s using isokinetic dynamometry. Results: QuadEcc and HamCon were not significantly
      related to ATSF at any testing velocity (p &gt; 0.05). QuadEcc/HamCon was significantly
      related to ATSF at 60°/s (r = 0.529, p = 0.005) and 180°/s (r = 0.556, p = 0.003). Conclusion:
      QuadEcc and HamCon in isolation are not significantly related to ATSF. However, when
      considered as a functional ratio, these strength measures are predictors of ATSF. This
      suggests that high QuadEcc/HamCon ratios may predispose female athletes to higher ATSF and ACL
      injury risk. Key Words: knee injury, ACL, torque, strength ratios</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>To understand how organizations spread campaign messages, which directly relates to
      the theory of agenda building, a communication audit of the Heart Truth campaign and its Red
      Dress symbol was conducted. Through document analysis of campaign materials and interviews
      with campaign planners, an in-depth examination of the campaign’s planning, strategies,
      tactics, executions, challenges, and successes are presented. Discussion of these elements as
      well as a SWOT analysis reveals the agenda-building strategies that were most successful for
      this campaign, which include awareness events, partnership building, grassroots outreach, and
      media outreach. The campaign audit concludes with a set of recommendations for moving forward
      with the campaign, and describes how this modernday campaign is an excellent model of agenda
      building that other groups can emulate.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis examines the effects of customization and recommendation source on reader
      perceptions of a news website. It contributes to the existing literature by examining the
      influence of these variables in concert as well as in isolation. It seeks to strengthen our
      knowledge of the mechanisms underlying persuasion in online news by exploring the role of
      several potential mediators: perceived relevance, novelty, interactivity, and involvement. It
      investigates the impact on perceived credibility, quality, and representativeness of articles
      presented on the website. It details the methods and results of an experiment (N=106) designed
      to examine the research questions. Results indicate that customization has a positive
      psychological effect on attitude toward the website and that the relationship is mediated by
      perceived relevance and interactivity. Findings suggest that recommendation source has no
      significant effect on attitude toward the website or articles. Theoretical and practical
      implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This research examined how courts have addressed the application of defamation law to
      new mass communications technologies—the telegraph, radio, and television—to contextualize the
      current application to the Internet. Three areas of defamation law were examined—the
      libel/slander distinction, the single publication rule, and liability. Through analyzing
      federal and state court cases, as well as relevant statutes, this thesis attempted to
      determine the extent to which our current approach to applying defamation law to the Internet
      fits into a historical pattern. Among the findings were that the application of the
      libel/slander distinction and the single publication rule to the Internet is consistent with
      common law developments that have arisen from other technologies; that for each technology,
      courts initially struggled to determine the appropriate liability to apply; and that statutes
      historically have played an integral role in the common law approach to liability for
      technologies.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Previous scholarship of the early twelfth-century Antependium of Saints Quiricus and
      Julitta has been limited to its inclusion in surveys documenting and categorizing the range of
      Catalan antependia from the late eleventh to thirteenth centuries. This thesis suggests that
      by taking into account the history and ideologies of the Reconquest and imbuing them with
      discourses on martyrdom, the antependium initiates a dialogue with the past that intertwines
      the remote memory of persecution with the salient notion of crusade. The presence of
      anti-Islamic sentiment, in part expressed by recasting contemporary Muslims as persecutors and
      idolaters akin to the Roman persecutors of the early Christian past, allows the antependium to
      be interpreted as visual manifestation of the changing ideology of the Reconquest. This thesis
      proposes a multivalent reading of the antependium that weaves the timeless notion of Christian
      sacrifice with contemporary perceptions of martyrdom and crusade.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study was generated to facilitate prospective students seeking a Master’s degree
      in the sport administration field. The field has expanded rapidly since its inception to
      academia in 1966, now encompassing over 200 programs nationwide. With this growth arose
      criticism and doubts from academic peers. Conducting research via faculty at sport management
      programs throughout the country, this study provides a detailed analysis of the academic
      field. Specifically, this study evaluates the curricula, academics, admissions and faculty
      resources in sport management and examines the relationships amongst the variables; thereby,
      supplying prospective students with the appropriate knowledge to evaluate a given sport
      management graduate program.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Jacques-Louis David’s The Loves of Paris and Helen (1789), which depicts the lovers
      embracing in a secluded and sumptuous bedroom, differs from his previous work in its choice of
      amatory rather than heroic or didactic subject. David perceived this commission as an
      opportunity to explore new aesthetic terrain by focusing on the complexities of mythology as
      an intellectual category. Contemporary debate defined the duality of myth: la fable as the sum
      total of cultural products related to these stories and la mythologie as the complex
      psychological meanings behind the legends. David’s painting is correspondingly bifocal.
      Primarily, he renders the lovers in a veristic and accurate setting, appropriating the
      mythological and erotic to his own contemporary aesthetic. Secondarily, by drawing upon the
      deep literary and visual history behind this story, the artist displays the characters’
      ambiguity and offers a visual speculation on the psychological forces which lie behind their
      union.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study examines the religious music of John Dowland as it relates to his
      association with the Elizabethan cult of melancholy. In examining his music, I have
      distinguished several different types of melancholy and I feel that Dowland’s musical
      treatment of these types is more nuanced then has yet been recognized. While scholars from the
      early modern era realized that the complaint of melancholy was a highly complex, multi-faceted
      issue, modern scholars tend to identify the melancholy tendencies of Dowland’s music as a
      one-dimensional concept. By exploring the expression of religious melancholy in the music of
      Dowland through the lens of contemporaneous medical and religious treatises, I am applying the
      early seventeenth-century conception of melancholy in my own interpretation of Dowland’s
      religious-themed music.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Globalization and the rapid emergence of technology have created a new domain in which
      friendly and enemy information sources operate: the global information environment (GIE). This
      new domain is a departure from the historical military-domestic media relationship because now
      Army Public Affairs Officers (PAOs) cannot address only the American people with their
      communications. They currently address both domestic and international audiences – especially
      during war. With public relations roles theory as its basis, this thesis contains qualitative
      and quantitative methods to determine the extent to which PAOs are performing diplomacy
      through their interaction with foreign media and publics. Furthermore, this thesis provides
      two options for transforming all or some PAOs into Public Diplomacy Officers (PDOs.)</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study focuses on the significance of gender constructions in popular videogames,
      both in terms of how they are constituted rhetorically, and on how these constructions may be
      alternatively constructed. Utilizing critical methods growing out of the rhetorical theories
      of Kenneth Burke, this study critically analyzes what rhetorically constitutes popular, and
      often problematic, gender constructions in mainstream videogames. Building upon the work of
      various videogame theorists and scholars, the study also examines the possibilities of
      constituting alternative constructions of gender in videogames, particularly through the
      analysis of the game Beyond Good and Evil which exemplifies an oppositional rhetorical force
      toward common and stereotypical gender constructions utilized in contemporary videogames. By
      engaging the common constructions of videogame gender, and the game Beyond Good and Evil,
      critically this study continues the argument against more traditionally patriarchal
      constructions of gender in favor of greater interactive freedom for the user in constructing
      gender identities.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Among Caravaggio’s most critically successful commissions, the Contarelli Chapel’s
      Calling of St. Matthew was also his first major, public, religious historia, and a turning
      point in the artist’s stylistic progression. Caravaggio’s Calling of St. Matthew is a highly
      self-referential painting, a demonstration piece in the fullest sense, and yet, scholarship
      has not considered the canvas as a statement about “painting,” aside from noting its explicit
      reference to Michelangelo’s Sistine Creation of Adam. This paper interprets the Calling as a
      painting about “painting,” drawing attention to the prominent window, Caravaggio’s use of
      light and color, and other formal aspects. It situates the Calling’s self-reference in
      relation to contemporary criticism and biographies of the artist, positing the painting as an
      “artist-in-his-studio” picture and exploring the Calling’s interaction with its facing
      pendant, the Martyrdom of St. Matthew.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>I argue that none of the main accounts of our fiduciary obligations can explain why we
      should keep our promises in all (or most) cases that involve binding promises. T. M. Scanlon’s
      expectation view is subject to a fatal circularity in paradigm cases in which our only reason
      to keep a promise is an awareness that, having made a promise, we are obligated to keep it.
      Hume’s view cannot explain why we ought to keep a promise the breaking of which is unlikely to
      undermine the institution of promising. And Rawls’ view (along with Hume’s) cannot explain why
      it is wrong to break promises that are made when no institution of promising exists. After
      arguing for these claims, I sketch a pluralist account according to which a family of
      fiduciary principles, including ones similar to those suggested by Hume, Rawls and Scanlon,
      explains why we ought to keep our promises.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Although now accepted almost universally, the "Laryngeal Theory" of
      Indo-European linguistics has been criticized in the past as being too abstract and
      formalistic; making excessive claims for the effects of the posited
      "laryngeal" segments; and implying typologically odd features of the
      proto-language. This study addresses a small subset of these concerns by statistically
      measuring the degree of correlation between two phenomena which the Laryngeal Theory implies
      should be correlated. These are the "prothetic vowel" of Greek, and the
      lengthened reduplication-syllable of certain Sanskrit perfects. Both of these are attributed
      by the Laryngeal Theory to the presence of a laryngeal segment at the beginning of the root in
      proto-Indo-European. If the Laryngeal Theory is correct, there should be more roots whose
      reflexes show both of these developments than should occur by chance. The correlation is
      measured by the Fisher's Exact test. For the set of all roots as defined traditionally, the P
      value is 0.25349; for roots grouped together without distinguishing between root-extensions
      and similar alterations, the value is 0.26401; and for resonant-initial roots the value is
      0.67371. These figures are consistent with the predicitons of the Laryngeal Theory, but also
      with the hypothesis that both the Greek prothetic vowel and the Sanskrit long-reduplicant
      perfects are due to epenthesis before resonant-initial roots.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis starts with the following questions: why is it important today to talk,
      write and think about memory in contexts of violence? Why is it crucial within the practices
      of everyday life, for the creation of identities and the construction of the future? How can
      we understand the importance of the politics and ethics of memory in contexts where the
      violence operates in different levels of everyday life? I began to raise these questions after
      exploring these issues in the last year with the Process of Black Communities (PCN) of the
      Pacific Coast in Colombia. I explored through my documentary practice and research the
      implementation of truth, justice and reparation for their communities by connecting present
      struggles with the historical memory of slave trade. Hence, my work explores the articulations
      between politics, cultural memory and violence that are established through the practice of
      this social movement in contemporary Colombia.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis examines artist Nikki S. Lee’s Projects photographs taken from 1997 to
      2001 and their entanglement with discourses of culture and identity. In this series, a
      collection of snapshots captures Lee in different guises as she engages with members of
      several cultural communities after whom she models her appearance. Through her peculiar use of
      the snapshot vernacular, Lee challenges subject-object binaries fixed to the glossy surface of
      the photograph, thus making questionable the verity of the Projects photographs. Projects
      urges the viewer to reconstruct narratives to reconcile the indeterminate relationships
      between Lee and her hosts and more significantly between the viewer and members of each
      depicted culture. These ambiguities elicit and address questions about the complex and often
      problematic visual expressions of identity and the subtle ways that such representations both
      promote and challenge dominant visual paradigms of society.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The thesis I defend in this paper is that the truth—or lack thereof—of our ascriptions
      of propositional attitudes need not carry ontological weight onto our theories about the
      nature of mental states. This claim would not be surprising if it weren’t for the fact that
      both Fodorian realists and eliminative materialists about propositional attitudes take it as a
      premise in their arguments. They do so, I argue, because both assume a realist stance
      regarding scientific theories. I claim that we would be better off if we reject this
      underlying assumption. At the end I suggest an alternative strategy for interpreting our
      ascriptions of propositional attitudes inspired by an anti-realist view on scientific
      theories. This view, I hope, may relieve the philosopher of mind from awkward ontological
      concerns regarding the nature of propositional attitudes.</mods:abstract>

      with cyclone and anticyclone characteristics (e.g. pressure, location, and time) from
      microfilmed surface weather maps are examined for 237 winter weather events at Greensboro,
      North Carolina over a 37 year period. The data is used to explore precipitation type
      determination and synoptic (large scale) pattern influence on intensity. A model for
      predicting precipitation type (i.e. a nomogram) is developed from the sounding and climate
      data. The tracks of the cyclones and anticyclones are classified and used to characterize the
      intensity of observed snow, freezing rain and sleet in the study area.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study is predicated on the need for a strategy to better teach writing to high
      school students with learning disabilities. Most schools of education do a good job of showing
      new teachers how to teach writing to non-disabled students, but sometimes do not teach
      specific strategies for teaching writing to students with learning disabilities. This paper
      first examines several different strategies designed to teach writing to students with
      learning disabilities, then picks a strategy developed by researchers at the University of
      Kansas and examines how well this strategy works with learning disabled students in a real
      world public high school resource class. Specifically, this researcher attempts to replicate
      the original research findings.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The generation manipulation produces the classic functional dissociation between
      explicit and implicit memory. This dissociation has been explained by the transfer-appropriate
      processing framework, which emphasizes a match between the cognitive operations required at
      encoding and at retrieval. However, the vast majority of implicit memory studies have been
      conducted in the visual modality; in the auditory modality, the effects of generation in
      particular have never been investigated. Three experiments examined the effects of generating
      from semantic cues on various auditory implicit tests. Generating from antonyms produced a
      negative generation effect on priming in auditory perceptual identification and word-stem
      completion, while producing the traditional positive effect on explicit recognition.
      Generating from definitions also produced a negative generation effect on auditory priming.
      These results are critical for characterizing auditory priming given the generation paradigm’s
      importance in dissociating explicit and implicit memory in the visual domain.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Previous research in crisis communication has shown that a corporation’s history of
      crises has a damaging effect on reputation during a current crisis. This study uses an
      experiment with student subjects testing not only the effect of a corporation’s own crises on
      reputation, but also the reputational effect of a corporation without a crisis history but in
      an industry with a history of similar crises, called extraorganizational crisis history.
      Findings of this experiment show that publics’ knowledge of extraorganizational crisis history
      may protect an organization’s reputation in a crisis. Theoretical and practical implications
      of this finding are discussed and further research is suggested.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle is accomplished in large part by well-timed
      and targeted destruction of proteins that inhibit or activate passage through cell cycle
      transitions. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is well established as the primary mechanism
      through which this occurs, and the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), an E3 ubiquitin ligase,
      is a vital regulatory component of this system. The APC is a multi-subunit complex required
      for cell cycle transitions that include progression through anaphase, exit from mitosis, as
      well as many events throughout meiosis. Two APC subunits, Apc2 and Apc11, are necessary for
      catalytic transfer of ubiquitin to target substrates, while the remaining subunits participate
      in a variety of regulatory mechanisms that coordinate APC activity with other cell cycle
      events. The primary mechanisms of APC regulation include co-activator protein association and
      phosphorylation of specific subunits in the complex. In budding yeast, two proteins, Mnd2 and
      Swm1, were identified by mass spectrometry after co-purification with the APC subunit, Cdc27.
      Here, I show that the APC co-purifies with epitope-tagged Mnd2 or Swm1 and that both proteins
      are present on the APC at stoichiometric levels throughout the mitotic cell cycle. Mnd2 that
      co-purifies with the APC is phosphorylated in a cell cycle dependent manner. Using a variety
      of mass spectrometry techniques, I found that phosphorylation occurs on a least 8 serine or
      threonine residues within the Mnd2 primary structure. Yeast strains that harbor alanine
      phosphorylation site mutations in Mnd2 progress normally through pre-meiotic S phase, but are
      unable to progress efficiently through the first nuclear division of meiosis. In contrast,
      yeast harboring aspartic acid phosphorylation site mutations display a partial recovery of the
      wild type meiosis phenotype. Alanine phosphorylation site mutants also displayed low levels of
      the APCAma1 meiotic substrate, Clb5. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Mnd2 is a
      stoichiometric component of the APC during mitosis and that Mnd2 phosphorylation is necessary
      for APC-mediated progression beyond the first meiotic nuclear division.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The clinical success of endosseous implants is associated with the formation and
      maintenance of bone at implant surfaces. Based on in vivo observations, several
      generalizations have been derived regarding the nature of the interface. Most prominently,
      initial cell and molecular adhesion dictate the reactivity of the interface. The aim of this
      project is to use interfacial biomaterials (Ti-binding peptides) to graft cell adhesive
      peptides to titanium surfaces used for osseointegrated endosseous implants. We hypothesized
      that there is statistical significant difference in the differentiation of cells adherent with
      Ti-binding peptide treated and untreated on titanium surfaces. We used the peptide (AFF6008)
      can facilitate the adhesion of biologically active peptides to the titanium surface. Scanning
      electron microscopy was used to quantify cell adhesion on treated and untreated surfaces. Real
      time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure and compare osteoblast-specific gene

               <mods:abstract>It has been reported that matrixmetalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is present in dentin, but
      its distribution and significance in human dentin are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To
      identify MMP-2 and determine its distribution in human coronal dentin. METHODS:
      Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the distribution of MMP-2 in coronal dentin.
      Freshly extracted human premolars and 3rd molars (age range 12-30) were fixed with
      formaldehyde, demineralized with 10% EDTA (pH=7.4) and embedded in paraffin. Five [micrometer]
      serial sections were made and subjected to analysis using a monoclonal anti-MMP-2 antibody
      with an avidin-biotin-complex method. Immunoreactivity was visualized with 3,3'-
      diaminobenzidine substrate and observed under light microscopy. ImageJ software was used to
      calculate the relative amount/distribution of MMP-2. Based on immunohistochemical results,
      crowns of freshly extracted human 3rd molars (age range 15-32) were sectioned, pulp and
      predentin tissue was removed, dentin matrix was extracted with EDTA and guanidine- HCl, pH7.4,
      and subjected to Western blot analysis with monoclonal anti-MMP-2 antibody and zymography.
      RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed immunoreactivity for MMP-2 throughout human
      coronal dentin. However, intense immunoreactivities were identified in a 90-200 [micrometer]
      zone adjacent to the pre-dentin as well as a 9-10 [micrometer] wide zone adjacent to the
      dentinoenamel junction (DEJ). Biochemical strategies detected MMP-2 as ~66 and ~72 kDa
      proteins (mature and proform of MMP-2, respectively). Furthermore, gelatinolytic activity was
      detected in the extracts. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that MMP-2 may be involved in
      extracellular matrix organization and dentin mineralization in predentin matrix. In addition,
      its concentration in the zone immediately adjacent to the DEJ and the retained enzymatic
      activity after demineralization suggest that MMP-2 may play a role in the spread of early
      dentin caries along DEJ. Supported by NIH grants DE10489, DE015876 and the UNC School of
      Dentistry.</mods:abstract>

      recognize abnormalities and initiate referral when necessary; 2) The dental hygienist is only
      helpful with tobacco cessation if the patient has a desire to quit; 3) The dental hygienist is
      most effective if the patient believes the provider truly cares about the patient's
      well-being; and 4) There is always a need for continued education in oral cancer screenings
      and tobacco cessation, specifically for hands-on courses. Barriers to performing OPC exams
      include: financial, time, and insufficient dentist support. Barriers to tobacco cessation
      include: lack of patient interest, education materials and resources; smoking parents of
      adolescents; personality issues and provider-patient diversity. Barriers need to be addressed
      to improve oral cancer control efforts.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Cryptochromes are flavoproteins that function as blue-light photoreceptors to regulate
      growth in plants and to entrain the circadian clock in animals. The photochemical and
      signaling mechanisms by which cryptochromes function are still undefined. Two cryptochromes
      identified in Danaus plexippus have shown distinct in vivo activities where DpCry1 is similar
      to Drosophila melanogaster cryptochrome and DpCry2 is similar to mammalian cryptochromes. I
      purified and biochemically characterized both D. plexippus cryptochromes. DpCry1 is the first
      animal cryptochrome to contain near-stoichiometric flavin. Photoreduction of FADox to FAD°¯
      and fluorescence lifetime measurements showing an extremely short lifetime of flavin in DpCry1
      both suggest a novel photochemical mechanism for DpCry1. DpCry2 contained only trace amounts
      of flavin and both proteins contained sub-stoichiometric MTHF. Purification of DpCry1 as the
      first animal cryptochrome with near-stoichiometric flavin will enable crucial in vitro
      biochemical and biophysical experiments that have never been conducted on an animal
      cryptochrome.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>A series of experiments involving 3 orthodontic departments has shown that distance
      learning can be acceptable to residents and effective in teaching concepts that are
      fundamental to orthodontic practice. The improvement from pre- to post-test scores after
      observing a sequence of distance seminars was similar to direct instruction. Orthodontic
      residents rated the educational experiences very positively. Live participation in seminars
      via video conferencing was preferred to live observation or later observation of a recording,
      but observation provided similar improvement in test scores. The acceptability of the distance
      seminars appeared to be influenced by the instructor's personality and teaching style in
      facilitating interaction, the seminar subject, the residents' comfort level in dealing with
      this technology, and the sequence for interaction vs observation. Further development of
      recorded seminars with live follow-up discussions has the potential to supplement instruction
      in graduate orthodontic programs and help with the impending shortage of experienced fulltime
      orthodontic faculty.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are downstream effectors of signal transducers
      including Rac and Cdc42. PAKs are involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements during cell
      migration, mitosis, dendritic spine formation, and neurite outgrowth. While the general
      expression pattern of PAKs in the brain was known, possible effects of PAK kinase activity on
      early brain development had not been described. I studied the expression pattern of activated
      PAKs 1-3 by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence in embryonic mouse brains and the effect of
      disruption of PAK activity during development on radial migration and early neuronal
      remodeling at the cortical plate. Active PAKs were observed in progenitor cells, in which they
      were coexpressed with PAK1 phosphorylated at T212, and in the developing cortical plate.
      Disruption of PAK activity did not affect radial cell distribution in the neocortex or neurite
      number in early neurons in the cortical plate.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to determine the perceived role of the Student American
      Dental Hygienists' Association (SADHA) in mentoring dental hygiene students for the future.
      After IRB exemption a pilot tested questionnaire was administered using Survey Monkey, an
      online survey website, to 277 individual contacts at American Dental Association (ADA)
      accredited dental hygiene (DH) programs. A response rate of 68% was achieved (n=186). Eighty
      percent indicated offering no mentoring opportunities, while 58.3% felt they actively mentor
      through SADHA. Respondents ranked community service/philanthropy as the main focus of SADHA.
      Baccalaureate degree completion programs offer more mentoring opportunities (p=&lt;.001)
      while baccalaureate programs offer additional topics from guest speakers beyond dental product
      presentations (p=.038). Efforts should be made to increase perception of the importance of the
      student professional association through the development of Best Practices for SADHA. This
      could benefit students by increasing mentoring opportunities and partnerships with local ADHA
      organizations.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study evaluated the correlation between laser fluorescence readings and the
      extent of carious tooth structure as measured by the volume of tooth preparation in vitro. One
      hundred and three permanent molars and premolars containing incipient occlusal caries were
      selected. DIAGNOdent and QLF readings were obtained according to manufacturer instructions.
      Caries was removed with ¼ round burs in high speed. The amount of uncured composite needed to
      fill the prepared cavity was used to calculate the volume of tooth preparation. The Pearson
      correlation for preparation volume and maximum DIAGNOdent reading and QLF measurements was
      0.285 and 0.399 respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of DIAGNOdent was .83 and .60 and
      .66 and .73 for the cut-off values of 20 and 30 respectively. Within the limitations of this
      study, it is possible to conclude that laser fluorescence measured with DIAGNOdent and QLF
      does not appear to correlate well with tooth preparation volume.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>A group of athletic trainers and physical therapists were surveyed to determine which
      ankle braces they recommend most frequently to prevent ankle sprain injury, which factors
      associated with brace use influence decisions about ankle brace recommendation, and to
      determine if perceptions about factors associated with brace use are related to patterns of
      ankle brace recommendation. The ASO brace was the ankle brace recommended most frequently.
      Clinicians reported effectiveness in preventing ankle sprain injury was the most influential
      factor when recommending a specific ankle brace. Additionally, clinicians reported comfort of
      an ankle brace was the next most influential factor. Clinicians' concern about reduced ankle
      muscle strength after wearing an ankle brace for a period of time was related to the
      likelihood of whether they would recommend use of an ankle brace for patients after an ankle
      sprain injury.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The etiology of skeletal Class III malocclusion is multifactorial, complex and likely
      results from mutations in numerous genes. In this study, we sought to understand the
      phenotype/genotype correlation of the Class III trait in 3 specific populations, a Colombian
      cohort, Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI) cohort and a Caucasian cohort. The phenotype was
      evaluated using multiple statistical comparisons of 3 populations followed by genetic analysis
      of 2 populations. Phenotypic analysis indicated a difference between the z-scores of 10
      cephalometric variables among the 3 groups. Pedigree analysis by inspection supported an
      autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with incomplete penetrance. A Genome-wide scan and
      linkage analysis of members in 2 cohorts revealed 3 regions suggestive of linkage for the
      Colombian cohort but was inconclusive for the AI cohort. Our phenotypic and genetic analysis
      highlights that each group is unique, and that differences between them could be due to
      specific craniofacial morphologic features.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) gel on intracanal
      bacteria reduction during root canal instrumentation. The additional antibacterial effect of
      an intracanal dressing (Ca(OH)2 mixed with 2% CHX gel) was also assessed. Forty-three patients
      with apical periodontitis were recruited. Teeth were instrumented using rotary instruments and
      2% CHX gel as the disinfectant solution. Bacterial samples were taken upon access (S1), after
      instrumentation (S2), and following 2 weeks of intracanal dressing (S3). Anaerobic culture was
      performed. Of the samples cultured positively at S1, 10.3% (4/39) and 8.3% (4/36) sampled
      bacteria at S2 and S3, respectively. A significant difference in the percentage of positive
      culture between S1 and S2 (p&lt;0.001), but not between S2 and S3 (p=0.692), was found.
      These results suggest that 2% CHX gel is an effective root canal disinfectant and additional
      intracanal dressing did not significantly improve the bacteria reduction on the sampled root
      canals.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Previous studies evaluated the stability of Class III corrective surgeries: mandibular
      setback, maxillary advancement, and bimaxillary surgery. According to one study, 40% of Class
      III patients seeking orthognathic surgery presented with a clinically detectable asymmetry. In
      our retrospective study, the purpose was to determine whether differences existed in the one
      year post-surgical stability of asymmetric Class III correction for three surgical procedures.
      We utilized cephalometric and panoramic radiographic analyses to compare the stability of
      asymmetric Class III patients including 43 bimaxillary surgery, 24 maxillary advancement, and
      15 mandibular setback patients. Our analysis revealed that stability in the horizontal
      direction was greatest for bimaxillary surgery group and least for the mandibular setback
      group, while stability in the vertical direction was the exact opposite. Overall, our study
      suggests the anteriorposterior one year surgical stability tendency of asymmetric Class III
      patients is similar to that of other Class III samples, but differs in the vertical direction.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Unique quantitative sensory testing methods and associated testing apparatus developed
      by Tommerdahl et. al. have enabled objective evaluation of intra-cortical communication
      mechanisms, which appears to be sensitive to neurologic disorders that impair normal sensory
      function. The proposed non-invasive diagnostic procedure enabling objective assessment of the
      status of the glia in sensory cortex of a patient has the potential for significant impact in
      the fields of gerontology, toxicology, and general medicine in the way of autism and chronic
      pain diagnosis, and acute head injury assessment. A central aim of this project is efficient
      storage of data obtained from disparate research locations into a centralized database,
      accessible to all researchers utilizing this same testing method and apparatus. Due to its
      aggregate nature of many different data sources, this ontological database will allow for
      invaluable data mining across a growing population of subject and patient observations.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to compare treatment times for serial extractions (SE)
      and late premolar extractions (LPE) for a cost-effectiveness analysis. A retrospective chart
      review identified 51 SE and 49 LPE patients. PAR scores were obtained at the initiation (PAR
      T1) and completion (PAR T2) of active orthodontic treatment. PAR T1 scores for the SE patients
      were significantly less than that for the LPE patients (p&lt;0.001) whereas PAR T2 scores
      were not significantly different. Activetreatment time was significantly less for the SE group
      as compared to the LPE group (p&lt;0.001). Total time (mos. pre-active + active-treatment)
      and total number of visits was significantly greater for the SE group as compared to the LPE
      group (p&lt;0.001). Total chair time (min.) was not significantly different between
      groups. Serial extractions may reduce active-treatment time for severe crowding but a
      significant time and effort precedes active-treatment.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Three common haplotypes of the human catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene are
      associated with experimental pain sensitivity. Based on subjects' pain responsiveness,
      haplotypes were designated as low (LPS), average (APS), or high (HPS) pain sensitive; APS and
      HPS haplotypes exhibit lower COMT enzymatic activity. Minor frequency SNPs naturally occur
      within the APS and HPS haplotypes, but their functional impact is unknown. We hypothesized
      that these minor SNPs, one occurring in the APS construct (G/A, rs769224) and three in the HPS
      construct (G/T, rs6267; G/A, rs740602; C/T, rs8192488), may compensate for the observed
      reductions in enzymatic activity. Testing was carried out via transient transfection of rat
      adrenal (PC-12) cells with each of the four constructs. No difference exists between the
      haplotype mutants and their respective parent haplotype for RNA abundance, protein expression,
      or enzymatic activity (P &gt; 0.05). Additionally, the minor allele of SNP re6267 is a
      likely marker of the HPS haplotype.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of the current study was to investigate the relationship between the
      attitudes of communication partners of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) users
      and device voice output (specifically the Tango! and DV4). Also, the study examined the
      relationship between attitudes and age of the communication partner of the AAC user. Six
      children, twenty-five pre-service Speech-Language Pathologists, and four in-service Speech-
      Language Pathologists familiar with AAC watched videos of an interaction between a child using
      AAC to communication with an adult. Following the videos, each participant responded to an
      attitude scale questionnaire. No significant effect was found for the child participant
      attitudes toward the Tango! and DV4. However, significant results were found between the
      devices for pre-service adults, in-service adults, and adults as a whole. Recommendations and
      clinical implications are suggested.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Subjects and Methods: Healthy subjects with pericoronitis were enrolled in an IRB
      approved study. Subject's were given a Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) instrument to
      assess the impact of pericoronitis in the previous week on: pain, lifestyle, and oral
      function. The impact of pericoronitis in the previous three months was recorded on Oral Health
      Impact Profile(OHIP-14). Because of sample size, analyses are limited to descriptive
      statistics. Results: Forty percent reported worst pain as severe. Oral function was
      compromised "quite a bit / lots" for eating 30%, chewing 23%, mouth opening
      10%. Mean OHIP severity score was 27 of 56. Conclusion: When clinicians carefully consider
      options for pain management in patients undergoing palliative treatment for acute
      pericoronitis, the reported data may alter their recommendations. In summary, acute episodes
      of pericoronitis can be associated with adverse life outcomes similar to the impact of third
      molar removal on pain and oral function.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>A new method for determining root canal working length (WL), the paper point technique
      (PPT), has been claimed to be accurate and reproducible, but has not been formally evaluated.
      Hypothesis: WL determination is more accurate when the Electronic Apex Locator Technique
      (EALT) is supplemented with PPT compared to EALT alone. The lengths of 84 root canals of
      unsalvageable human teeth were measured first using EALT, then PPT. Endodontic files were
      cemented to the position indicated by PPT. The teeth were extracted and microCTscanned. In 71
      canals that provided adequate readings for both EALT and PPT, the RCAE to file tip distance
      was measured to 20 ?m resolution. Both techniques showed (1) moderate agreement and (2)
      excellent repeatabilities. There was (3) a significantly greater accuracy in locating the RCAE
      when PPT was used compared to EALT alone (p[less than or equal to]0.0051). Conclusion: It may
      be advisable to supplement the EALT measurement with PPT.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to determine whether Cone Beam Computed Tomography
      (CBCT) synthesized cephalograms provide the same measurement accuracy and precision as
      conventional cephalograms. In Part I, cephalometric measurements of conventional and CBCT
      synthesized orthogonal or perspective projections of 10 skulls were compared with each other
      and with the actual skull measurements. In Part II, actual patient data was used to compare
      the three imaging modalities and both soft and hard tissue landmarks were utilized. This study
      demonstrated that most cephalometric measurements are not different for conventional and CBCT
      synthesized orthogonal and the perspective projections. Although there is a statically
      significant difference between mid-sagittal image measurements compared to actual skull
      measurements, these differences are very small .and are unlikely to have clinical relevance.
      Both of the projections can be used with an expectation of precision and accuracy similar to
      conventional cephalograms.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Research indicates that maternal language plays a crucial role in children's
      communication development, however, less is known about the relationships between maternal
      language use and children's early communication abilities within families from low income and
      rural environments. In order to better understand these relationships the current study
      examined the structure and content of mothers' language use when children were 6 months of age
      and again when the children were 15 months of age, within a sample of 82 mothers and their
      children who were living in low income, rural environments. Maternal language use was
      documented during book sharing interactions within the home at each time point, and
      information regarding children's communication abilities was obtained at the 15 month time
      point. The main aims of the investigation were to identify whether differences occurred in
      maternal language use across the two time points and to analyze the potential relationships
      between mothers' language use and children's early communication abilities. Among mother-child
      dyads there was a great deal of variability in maternal language use and in the duration of
      book sharing interactions within time points. In addition, significant differences in both the
      structure and content of mothers' language were evident between the 6 and 15 month time
      points. Analyses also identified a significant predictive relationship between mothers' rate
      of use of specific language strategies and children's symbolic communication abilities. These
      findings emphasize the potential importance of mothers' use of language strategies that
      provide greater elaborated or abstract content. The results highlight the heterogeneity in the
      sample and demonstrate the utility of obtaining various measures of maternal language to more
      fully describe their interactions with their children, as only certain aspects of maternal
      language use were significant predictors of children's communication outcomes. Further, the
      current investigation reveals the value in examining children's early communication
      development within families who live in low income, rural environments.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a slowly progressive disease of airway
      obstruction. Current treatment guidelines recommen a stepwise increase in drug treatment
      depending on disease severity. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) should augment regular
      bronchodilators for patients with advanced disease and repeated exacerbations. This
      dissertation examined the timing and impact of ICS on exacerbation risks, utilization and
      costs among COPD patients in a large managed care database. A propensity-score-matching
      approach was used to compare patients who initiated ICS within three months of beginning
      bronchodilators with those who initiated ICS thereafter. A fixed-effects model approach was
      used to assess benefits of ICS augmenting regular exposure level and its associate with
      treatment outcomes. Early initiation of ICS was associated with a 7%-reduction in exacerbation
      risks, an 8%-reducation in all-cause medical costs, and a 23%-reduction in COPD-related
      medical costs. Reduction in medical costs was more than the increase in pharmacy costs
      indicating early ICS initiation achieved an overall cost reduction. The potential benefit of
      ICS also depended on the timing of therapy initiation. A six-month delay in ICS initiation
      was, on average, associated with cost increase of $306 overall or %51 per month for
      COPD-related services. The magnitude of cost reduction varied by age, and the oldest
      population had largest benefits. Access to specialist care and patient understanding of
      disease and treatment may be key factors to improving medication persistence and adherence.
      Patients with better persistence and adherence may have lower risks of inpatient admissions or
      emergency department visits, and treatment costs. However, observed associations were
      relatively small and inconsistent across various exposure and outcome measures. In conclusion,
      the findings consistently support that early ICS initiation, concomitant with bronchodilators
      rather in response to exacerbations uncontrolled by bronchodilators, is an important treatment
      strategy to achieve better symptom control and reduce overall treatment costs. Additional
      studies are required to address potential time-variant confounders, estimate longer-term
      outcomes and examine ICS effects among Medicare beneficiaries and patients with severe COPD
      symptoms.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Chlamydial and gonococcal infections are the two most commonly reported sexually
      transmitted infections in the United States. Screening programs in clinics, schools, and
      communities detect a substantial burden of infection. Extension of current recommended
      guidelines has been suggested through expanding screening settings. Emergency departments have
      been proposed as potentially promising venues for screening interventions. The purpose of this
      dissertation is to investigate the utility and obstacles associated with chlamydial and
      gonococcal screening in an emergency department. To examine this issue, we analyzed data from
      a cross-sectional and short duration prospective cohort study of patients aged 18 to 35 years
      attending a busy urban emergency department. The overall prevalence of infection in this
      population was 9.6%. Separately for males and females, we developed predictive models and
      applicable clinical risk scores for chlamydial and gonococcal infections combined and for
      chlamydial infection alone. Age was the strongest predictor of infection in all four models.
      We then used the sensitivities and specificities of the clinical risk scores to examine the
      trade-off in misclassification errors across varying prevalence of infection. Results of this
      analysis suggest that the consequences of undetected chlamydial and/or gonococcal infection
      must substantially outweigh the costs of screening to justify incorporating routine screening
      into emergency department services. In independent models, we evaluated the influence of
      healthcare coverage status and reporting the emergency department as the main source for
      healthcare on the risk of not receiving treatment and follow-up services for infections
      identified in the emergency department. Antibiotic use in the three months prior to the
      emergency department visit appears to modify both of these associations. Lastly, we described
      the geospatial distribution of the detected infections and their treatment outcomes. As
      screening programs move into emergency departments, serious consideration must be given to the
      costs associated with unnecessarily screening a significant number of patients to detect
      infections. In addition, consideration must be given to ensuring appropriate treatment and
      follow-up for all detected infections.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Mitotic recombination is an important mechanism of DNA repair in eukaryotic cells. I
      have developed a novel system that allows the selection of the reciprocal products resulting
      from spontaneous mitotic crossovers in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A number of other
      types of genetic events, including chromosome loss, can be monitored with this system. For a
      120 kb chromosome interval on chromosome V (CEN5 - CAN1), the rate of mitotic crossovers was 4
      x 10-5 per division, a rate approximately 25,000-fold lower than the meiotic rate of
      crossovers. We found no suppression of mitotic crossovers near the centromere of chromosome V,
      unlike the suppression observed for meiotic exchanges. A tract of trinucleotide repeats,
      (CTG)115, did not stimulate mitotic recombination or chromosome loss. The rate of reciprocal
      crossovers was substantially (38-fold) elevated by treatment of cells with hydroxyurea, a drug
      that reduces nucleotide pools and slows DNA replication. When cells were irradiated with 20
      J/m2 UV-light, a dose that results in 90% survival of the cells, mitotic crossovers were
      stimulated 175-fold. The effect of the mating-type alleles on spontaneous and induced
      recombination was also examined. Although the analysis with this system was limited to one
      genetic interval on chromosome V, the same approach can be extended to any region of the yeast
      genome.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The influence of diesel exhaust particles (DEP) on the lungs and heart is currently a
      topic of great interest in inhalation toxicology. Epidemiologic data and animal studies have
      implicated airborne particulate matter and DEP in increased morbidity and mortality due to a
      number of cardiopulmonary diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder,
      and lung cancer. The pathogeneses of these diseases are being studied using cell culture
      techniques. The current prevalent methodology for evaluating the effects of DEP on cells in
      culture (exposure to particles suspended in culture media) does not reflect lung delivery of
      these materials to human lungs. Consequently, the effects of DEP exposure may be difficult to
      elucidate. A method of in vitro DEP deposition that more closely mimics the in vivo dosing and
      deposition would be a desirable and useful alternative. It was proposed that DEP delivered as
      aerosols to cells in culture is physiologically relevant and would result in measurable
      inflammatory responses of toxicological significance. The specific aims of this dissertation
      were addressed by: (i) generating DEP aerosols in a size range relevant to lung deposition and
      characterizing those aerosols; (ii) formulating methods for deposition of those aerosols onto
      cells in culture; (iii) studying the effects of DEP exposure following this type of deposition
      on reactive oxygen species formation, the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, and
      viability. Several commercial particle sizing instruments and a novel device were used to
      deposit DEP aerosols onto the apical surface of Calu-3, A549, and/or 16HBE14o- cells by
      inertial impaction. Deposition of DEP aerosols onto A549 cells in the novel device elicited a
      cellular response that precludes their use in studies of toxicity. Deposition by inertial
      impaction did not appear to affect Calu-3 cells, and the response of these cells to exposure
      to DEP aerosols was shown to be different from the response to exposure to DEP as a media
      suspension. Methods of re-dispersing aerosols of DEP, sampling onto cell surfaces, and
      studying their effect were established and demonstrate the utility and relevance of this
      approach.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Liver regeneration after surgical partial hepatectomy (PH) in animals exposed to the
      mito-inhibitory agent retrorsine is completed through the outgrowth and expansion of small
      hepatocyte-like progenitor cells (SHPCs). Although the SHPC-mediated regenerative response has
      been well characterized in the retrorsine/PH model of liver injury, the role that these cells
      play in other forms of liver injury has not been investigated. The experimental objectives of
      the current studies were: (i) to characterize SHPC responses in hepatotoxic and necrotic
      models of liver injury, (ii) to determine the progenitor cell of origin of SHPCs, and (iii) to
      identify factors involved in the activation of SHPCs after liver injury. SHPCs are not
      observed after PH in retrorsine-exposed rats treated with the mito-inhibitory agent 2-
      acetamidofluorene, but are observed after PH in retrorsine-exposed rats treated with the
      biliary toxin 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane. Together, these observations suggest strongly that
      oval cells do not represent progenitor cells of SHPCs, but that SHPCs represent another liver
      progenitor cell population that resides in the hepatic parenchyma and responds to certain
      forms of liver injury. In addition, these investigations found that SHPCs respond to restore
      liver mass and structure when retrorsine-exposed rats are treated with the pericentral
      necrotizing agent carbon tetrachloride. This observation shows that SHPCs are capable of
      regenerating liver damaged by surgical resection as well as chemically-induced necrotic
      injury. Finally, these studies establish that treatment of retrorsine-exposed rats with the
      cytokine inhibitor dexamethasone blocks SHPC proliferation after PH and that this blockade can
      be overcome by administration of recombinant IL6 protein. These observations suggest that
      SHPCs are activated for proliferation in a cytokine-dependent manner similar to other
      regenerative cell populations in liver (mature hepatocytes, oval cells), and that IL6 may
      function as the master regulatory molecule for activation of progenitor cell responses after
      liver injury. Together, these investigations provide evidence that a hierarchy of cellular
      responses exists in the mammalian liver in which the form of regenerative response occurring
      after liver injury reflects (i) the type of liver injury, and (ii) the progenitor cell
      populations that are capable of proliferating.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Purpose: To better understand the medication-related concerns of dementia caregivers,
      their impact on caregiver emotional health and to identify potential areas for interventions
      that might assist them with medication management and reduce their overall stress and burden.
      Scope: Since demented patients lose their cognitive ability to manage their own medications
      early in the disease process, informal caregivers are involved with this sometimes complex
      process for an extended period of time which has the potential to cause a great deal of
      burden, anxiety and frustration. Methods: This research study was conducted using a sample of
      139 caregivers of persons with memory problems recruited from caregiver support groups, clinic
      settings and an online listserv. Results: Caregivers who reported lower levels of social
      support and had more difficulty handling the medication effects reported higher depression
      scores. Less than half of the caregivers surveyed believed that their pharmacist was proactive
      in communicating drug information or that there was a private place within the pharmacy to do
      this. Conclusions: The findings suggest that medication-related stressors are associated with
      poorer emotional health outcomes in caregivers. The descriptive analysis of caregiver's
      attitudes about pharmacists and pharmacy services also suggests that there are things that can
      be done to assist caregivers to improve the relationship and communication with their
      pharmacist.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), fluorescence correlation
      spectroscopy (FCS) and Single particle tracking (SPT) are common biophysical methods to
      measure lateral mobility of membrane molecules. These methods typically sample lateral
      mobility in micron-sized regions of the membrane so that they can be used to measure diffusion
      in regions of single cells. The methods are based on fluorescence from the molecules of
      interest or from light scattered from particles attached to single or small groups of membrane
      lipids or proteins. FRAP methodologies are described for a dedicated wide field microscope,
      which can be applied to confocval-based FRAP too. SPT can be applied to track single
      fluorescent molecules in membranes but this aspect will not be treated in detail. SPT has been
      a useful tool to study the micro-structure of membranes on various time scales. Using SPT, we
      found that by deliberately cross-linking several glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored
      proteins under antibody conjugated 40-nm gold particles, transient anchorage of the
      gold-labeled clusters occurred for periods ranging from 300 ms to 10 seconds. This phenomenon
      was observed with two different GPI-anchored proteins: Thy-1 and CD73, a 5' exonucleotidase.
      Cholesterol depletion and Src family kinase (SFK) inhibition abolished transient anchorage,
      indicating the involvement of cholesterol and SFKs in cross-linking dependent transient
      anchorage. Further evidence for the involvement of SFKs was obtained from Src, Yes, Fyn
      defective cells, in which transient anchorage of CD73 was not detected. Caveolin-1 knockout
      cells exhibited reduced transient anchorage time, suggesting the partial participation of
      caveolin-1. Additionally, in PI3 kinase inhibited IMR 90 cells expressing CD73, short-period
      transient anchorage (&lt; 1 second) increased sharply and no long-period anchorage
      occurred. By contrast, a transmembrane protein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
      regulator, exhibited transient anchorage without deliberately enhanced cross-linking;
      moreover, it was only slightly inhibited by cholesterol depletion or SFK inhibition and
      depended on interaction of its PDZ binding domain with the adaptor EBP50. We propose that
      cross-linked GPIAPs become transiently anchored via a cholesterol dependent, SFK-regulatable
      linkage between a transmembrane cluster sensor and the cytoskeleton.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The recently developed coronavirus reverse genetic systems have been a tremendous
      asset for improving our understanding of the viruses' complex replication strategy,
      pathogenesis, mechanisms of host-range expansion, and in the development of anti-viral
      therapies. We completed two studies using coronavirus infectious clones. The first evaluated a
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) vaccine to protect against an
      antigenically divergent strain. The second study determined the requirement for proteolytic
      processing of a highly conserved region of the replicase polyprotein for efficient
      replication. Ideally, a SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in
      vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains
      that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs. Using Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus
      replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S)
      glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N) as candidate
      vaccines, we tested their ability to protect young and senescent mice when challenged with
      homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV strains. The novel heterologous SARS-CoV strain
      (icGDO3-S) was constructed using synthetic biology and reverse genetics to generate a chimeric
      virus encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain,
      GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV, and represents a strain of SARS-CoV that
      emerged into the human population independently of the epidemic strain. VRP-S, but not VRP-N,
      provided protection for both young and senescent mice when challenged with the epidemic
      strain. When challenged with icGDO3-S, VRP-S protected young mice but only partially protected
      senescent animals. VRP-N vaccinated mice demonstrated enhanced pulmonary inflammation, which
      included eosinophils among the cellular infiltrates, following SARS-CoV or icGDO3-S challenge.
      The highly conserved region at the carboxy-terminus of the coronavirus replicase ORF1a
      polyprotein is processed by the main proteinase (Mpro) into mature products including nsp7,
      nsp8, nsp9 and nsp10, proteins with predicted or identified activities involved with RNA
      synthesis. Mpro continuous translation and processing of ORF1ab polyproteins is required for
      replication, but specific cleavage events may be dispensable. We determined the requirement
      for the nsp7-10 proteins and their proteolytic processing during the replication of murine
      hepatitis virus (MHV), which is phylogenetically grouped with the human coronaviruses OC43 and
      SARS-CoV. Using the MHV reverse genetics system, in frame deletions of the coding sequences
      for nsp7, 8, 9, and 10 were either deleted, or the flanking cleavage sites ablated, and the
      effect upon replication determined. Viable viruses were characterized through analysis of Mpro
      processing, subgenomic RNA transcription, and in vitro growth fitness. Deletion of any of the
      four regions encoding nsp7 through 10 was lethal. Disruption of the cleavage sites flanking
      the protein domains were lethal with the exception of the nsp9/10 cleavage site, which
      resulted in a mutant virus with severely attenuated replication. In order to determine if a
      distinct function could be attributed to preprocessed forms of the replicase polyprotein
      including nsp7-10, the genes encoding nsp7 and nsp8 were rearranged. The mutant virus MHV8/7
      was not viable, suggesting that the noncleaved intermediate protein may be essential for
      replication or proteolytic processing.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Human milk is the optimal nutrition for infants for the first six months of life.
      Healthy People 2010 includes national breastfeeding goals including 75% of women initiating
      breastfeeding, 50% continuing for at least six months, and 25% continuing for at least one
      year. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months,
      with continued breastfeeding for at least one year or as long as mutually desired by mother
      and child. In the United States, those who least likely to breastfeed are women who are
      African American, residents of the southeast, and WIC participants. This dissertation examines
      patterns and correlates of breastfeeding practices among North Carolina WIC clients from 1996
      through 2002. Because both macro- and micro-level factors can influence breastfeeding, the
      social ecological model is used as a theoretical framework to guide both papers. Beginning
      with an assessment of breastfeeding initiation and early introduction of human milk substitute
      (HMS) in the first paper, and following with an intentto- treat evaluation of an in-home
      postpartum breastfeeding support program, this dissertation attempts to identify individual
      and community factors associated with breastfeeding. Results indicate that breastfeeding

               <mods:abstract>Untimely progression through the cell cycle can lead to catastrophic and irreversible
      genetic anomalies. Therefore, the cell cycle must be tightly controlled and proceed
      unidirectionally. Cell cycle control is due in part to the targeted ubiquitinmediated
      proteolysis of regulatory proteins. The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is an essential E3
      ubiquitin ligase responsible for catalyzing the proteolysis of regulatory proteins in the cell
      cycle. Cdh1 is a co-activator of the APC aiding in the onset and maintenance of G1 phase,
      while phosphorylation of Cdh1 at the end of G1 phase by cyclin dependent kinases assists in
      the inactivation of APCCdh1. Here, we suggest additional components are involved in the
      inactivation of APCCdh1 independent of Cdh1 phosphorylation. These components were identified
      as Acm1, Bmh1, and Bmh2 in complex with Cdh1. Acm1 is cell cycle regulated and its levels are
      highest in S phase when APCCdh1 is inactive. Complex formation is dependent on the presence of
      phosphorylated Acm1. Acm1 alone is capable of inhibiting ubiquitination of Clb2 and Pds1 in
      vitro while overexpression of Acm1 rescues the lethality caused by overexpression of the
      constitutively active Cdh1 alanine phospho-mutant. Acm1 inhibition is specific to APCCdh1 as
      it does not inhibit APCCdc20 in vitro. While partially iii phosphorylated Cdh1 can still
      activate the APC, the addition of Acm1 decreases Clb2 ubiquitination when using either
      phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated Cdh1. Cdh1 contains three consensus D-box regions
      (R-X-X-L) and one KEN box region. Mutations of the 3rd D box and the KEN box of Cdh1 abolish
      its interaction with Acm1. The same mutant is unable to inhibit APCCdh1 activity in vitro and
      in vivo. Although full length Acm1 does not appear to be ubiquitinated while serving as an APC
      inhibitor, truncations of both the N-terminus and C-terminus of Acm1 convert the protein to an
      APCCdh1 substrate. We conclude Acm1 acts as a competitive inhibitor and blocks substrate
      binding to the Cdh1, thereby inactivating APCCdh1. Together, these findings suggest a novel
      means of APCCdh1 regulation exists that is independent of Cdh1 phosphorylation in yeast
      through inhibition by Acm1.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>BACKGROUND: The transition from adolescence to adulthood, referred to as emerging
      adulthood, is accompanied by an increase in risky sexual activity and injection drug use, two
      behaviors that are the main routes of transmission of sexually transmitted infections and HIV
      (STI/HIV). Given that adolescents and emerging adults are disproportionately affected by
      STI/HIV, understanding adolescent predictors of risk behaviors for STI/HIV in emerging
      adulthood is important to mitigate STI/HIV risk among youth. Three dimensions of friendships
      (friendship quantity, quality and the friends' risk behaviors) are particularly useful in
      predicting adolescents' and young adults' STI/HIV risk behaviors. These friendship dimensions
      have often been considered separately. But recent research suggests that they interact. This
      study therefore combined developmental and public health perspectives to examine whether
      dimensions of adolescent friendships interact to influence emerging adults' STI/HIV risk
      behaviors. Gender and racial differences were investigated. METHODS: Analyses were based on
      1,154 respondents, aged 12-18 years at baseline, who participated in Waves I and III of the
      National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The STI/HIV risk behaviors scale was created
      as a composite measure of the sexual activities and drug use behaviors that directly influence
      STI/HIV transmission. Independent variables included: number of friends (friendship quantity),
      emotional and behavioral closeness to friends (friendship quality), and friends' STI/HIV risk
      behaviors. Multiple linear regression models were used to examine the study's aims. RESULTS:
      In emerging adulthood, the mean number of STI/HIV risk behaviors respondents had engaged in
      was 3.26 (range: 0-7). No interaction effects were observed between friends' STI/HIV risk
      behaviors and: number of friends, emotional and behavioral closeness to friends. There was a
      weak positive relationship between STI/HIV risk behaviors in adolescence and those in emerging
      adulthood, and a direct effect of behavioral closeness to friends on STI/HIV risk behaviors in
      emerging adulthood. Most associations did not vary by gender or race. CONCLUSION: Closer
      friendships in adolescence predicted more STI/HIV risk behaviors in emerging adulthood,
      regardless of the friends' STI/HIV risk behaviors. Findings are discussed in light of
      developmental and public health perspectives on the importance of friendships in adolescence.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Chancroid is a sexually-transmitted infection (STI) prevalent in impoverished regions
      of the developing world. Caused by the gram-negative bacterium Haemophilus ducreyi (Hd), an
      obligate human pathogen, chancroid is characterized by purulent genital skin ulceration and
      increased risk of acquiring other STI including HIV. Chancroid is treatable with antibiotic
      therapy but does not elicit protective immunity to subsequent Hd infection. To further explore
      Hd-host interactions, we examined two targets: an Hd surface protein targeted by the host's
      modest anti-Hd humoral response, and a secreted Hd toxin implicated in pathogenesis and immune
      modulation. We identified Hd outer-membrane protein NcaA as an Oca-family bacterial adhesin.
      We demonstrated that NcaA mediated Hd binding to the host skin protein collagen. Furthermore,
      we found that NcaA was essential for virulence in human and swine models of chancroid,
      suggesting an important link between skin colonization and survival in the host. Most Hd
      isolates secrete cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), a trimeric complex that intoxicates many
      eukaryotic cell types, including some found in skin (fibroblasts, keratinocytes) and others
      relevant to immunity (macrophages, lymphocytes). We therefore investigated CDT as a
      contributor to Hd pathogenesis and host immune modulation. Two independent Hd CDT-deletion
      ([delta]CDT) mutants were attenuated in the swine chancroid model, but neither could be
      complemented, showing that CDT deletion selected for cryptic attenuating mutations. These
      results support but cannot confirm the importance of CDT to Hd pathogenesis. Additionally,
      pigs inoculated twice with [delta]CDT Hd were as susceptible to wild type Hd challenge as pigs
      previously inoculated twice with CDT+ Hd. Though this finding did not illustrate CDT-mediated
      immune alteration, [delta]CDT strains may not persist sufficiently in vivo to elicit immunity
      regardless of any CDT effect. Following published findings attributing CDT toxicity to
      nuclease activity of subunit CdtB, we generated an Hd mutant with minimal amino acid
      variations mapping to the CdtB active site, attempting to circumvent compensatory mutation.
      This mutant retained CDT toxicity; furthermore, purified mutant CdtB protein retained in vitro
      nuclease activity. Further studies are warranted to address the importance of CdtB nuclease
      activity and CDT toxicity to Hd host-pathogen interaction.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Nasal dry powder vaccines may provide safe, effective, stable, and affordable
      alternatives to currently available influenza vaccines. It was proposed that maximal mucosal
      and systemic antibody production would be elicited by a whole inactivated influenza virus dry
      powder nasal vaccine formulation in response to increased local residence time. Full factorial
      designed experiments examining freezing rate, solute concentration, and annealing
      (freeze-drying) and solution feed rate, atomization airflow rate, and solute concentration
      (spray-freeze-drying (SFD)) were used to produce particles suitable for nasal delivery.
      Freeze-drying followed by milling and sieving produced heterogeneous-shaped particles below
      the targeted particle size, which weren't ideal for blending with mucoadhesive compounds (MA).
      Optimized SFD runs produced particles for human (D50=38.5[micrometer]) and rat
      (D50=26.9[micrometer]) delivery which were characterized for flow and thermal properties,
      surface area, true density, moisture content, and impact energy separation and demonstrated
      improved storage stability than liquid formulations. A modified cascade impactor was
      calibrated to characterize particles in the 10-20[micrometer] size range. Wettability,
      dissolution rate, and swelling indices were obtained as potential predictors of the effects MA
      may have on the residence time. Gamma scintigraphy allowed for visual imaging of nasal
      clearance, while residence time studies quantified mucociliary clearance rates. In vitro and
      in vivo experiments indicated that sodium alginate (SA) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC-HMW)
      powder formulations had the greatest effect on increasing residence time in Brown Norway rats.
      A dose-response curve determined that a 2[microgram] dose was appropriate to quantify
      potential differences in antibody responses of formulations. IM delivery provided equivalent
      serum antibody titers to IN powder without MA, CMC-HMW, SA, and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
      (HPMC-HMW) after initial dosing and IN liquid and IN powder without-MA, CMC-HMW, SA, and
      HPMC-HMW after boosting. IN liquid vaccine provided equivalent serum antibody titers to IN
      powder without-MA, CMC-HMW, SA, chitosan, and HPMC-HMW after the initial vaccination. IN
      liquid provided significantly greater serum antibody titers than IN powder with chitosan after
      boosting. While no significant differences between powder and liquid formulations were
      observed, trends are consistent with residence time studies with respect to eliciting an
      immune response. Maximal serum and mucosal antibodies were elicited following administration
      of IN powder with SA.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The mammalian circadian clock is a global regulatory system that controls many aspects
      of physiology, including behavior, metabolism, cell cycle progression, and overall fitness.
      CRYPTOCHROMES (CRYs) are core elements of the mammalian circadian clock, and loss of CRY
      expression leads to arrythmicity. Although much work has been done analyzing the mammalian
      clock, the molecular mechanisms underlying the clock and resulting from its disruption are
      still largely unknown. There is growing evidence that circadian rhythm disruption in both
      humans and rodents leads to predisposition to cancer and poor prognosis; however, it has not
      been determined if cancer predisposition is a hallmark of all types of clock disruption. Here
      I present evidence that arrhythmic Cry1-/-Cry2-/- mice possess an intact DNA damage checkpoint
      and repair system and are not predisposed to ionizing radiation-induced cancers relative to
      wild-type mice. In addition, experiments were conducted to determine the direct effect, if
      any, that CRY1 exerts on CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer DNA-binding. I find that CRY1 neither
      inhibits nor modifies the DNA binding of a heterodimer consisting of BMAL1 and a 342-amino
      acid fragment of CLOCK (CLOCK342) in vitro. However, this does not rule out the possibility
      that CRY1 could have an effect on a heterodimer of BMAL1 and full-length CLOCK in vitro.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>DNA microarrays measure the expression of thousands of genes or DNA fragments
      simultaneously in which probes have specific complementary hybridization. Gene expression or
      microarray data analysis problems have a prominent role in the biostatistics, biological
      sciences, and clinical medicine. The first paper proposes a method for finding associations
      between the survival time of the subjects and the gene expression of tumor microarrays.
      Measurement error is known to bias the estimates for survival regression coefficients, and
      this method minimizes bias. The latent variable model is shown to detect associations between
      potentially important genes and survival in a breast cancer dataset that conventional models
      did not detect, and the method is demonstrated to have robustness to misspecification with
      simulated data. The second paper considers the Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL)
      detection problem. An eQTL is a genetic locus that influences gene expression, and the major
      challenges with this type of data are multiple testing and computational issues. The proposed
      method extends the Mixture Over Marker (MOM) model to include a structured prior probability
      that accounts for the transcript location. The new technique exploits the fact that genetic
      markers are more likely to influence transcripts that share the same location on the genome.
      The third paper improves the analysis of Chromatin (Ch)-Immunoprecipitation (IP) (ChIP)
      microarray data. ChIP-chip data analysis estimates the motif of specific Transcription Factor
      Binding Sites (TFBSs) by comparing the IP DNA sample that is enriched for the TFBS and a
      control sample of general genomic DNA. The probes on the ChIP-chip array are uniformly spaced
      on the genome, and the probes that have relatively high intensity in the IP sample will have
      corresponding sequences that are likely to contain the TFBS motif. Present analytical methods
      use the array data to discover peaks or regions of IP enrichment then analyze the sequences of
      these peaks in a separate procedure to discover the motif. The proposed model will integrate
      enrichment peak finding and motif discovery through a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Performance
      comparisons are made between the proposed HMM and the previously developed methods.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Despite access to health care long being central in health services research and
      policy, we still seek answers to fundamental questions. Access theory has also been criticized
      for being unsuccessful at predicting and explaining health care use, for being inapplicable to
      disadvantaged populations, and for treating access as a static phenomenon. I argue that we
      need a better understanding of the mechanisms and context of access and must pay attention to
      theory development. I designed this study to address these criticisms and better understand
      access to care. Using grounded theory, I examined the contextual and holistic nature of access
      by conducting an inductive investigation of disadvantaged individual's experiences in four
      rural communities. I conducted 42 individual and two-person in-depth, unstructured interviews
      on getting and using health care. Individuals in this study consisted of persons most likely
      to experience trouble using the health care system and to have the most need for care. The
      communities used in this study illustrated a variety of approaches to and problems with rural
      health care delivery in North Carolina and Ontario. Participants' access narratives described
      dealing with and struggling with competing needs and demands to achieve or maintain a state of
      balance in having their needs met. Achieving and maintaining balance is part of a dynamic
      process with four stages in the balance process: seeking balance, achieving balance,
      maintaining balance, and balance upsets. This continual process requires tradeoffs and
      adaptation as circumstances change. Getting stuck or being unable to achieve balance results
      in adverse consequences for the individual and the individual's relationship with the health
      care system. The balance process operates throughout an individual's life, reflecting careers
      with health needs and the health care system. This conceptualization of access as a balance
      process shares commonalities with existing access theories as well as contributing new
      concepts including the iterative nature of access and the importance of personal interactions
      and community context. Conceptualizing access as a staged process of achieving balance also
      provides multiple distinct policy intervention opportunities.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Forces play a critical role in a wide range of biological phenomena from single
      protein conformational dynamics, cell division, and mucociliary clearance, to name a few. The
      majority of existing instruments for microbiological force application can be divided into two
      categories; those that can apply relatively high forces through the use of a physical
      connection to a probe, and those that apply significantly smaller forces with a detached
      probe. Magnetic manipulators utilizing high fields and high field gradients have been able to
      reduce this gap in maximum applicable force, but the size of such devices has limited their
      use in applications where high force and high numerical aperture (NA) microscopy must be
      combined. This dissertation focuses on the development of a magnetic manipulation system that
      is capable of applying forces in excess of 700 pN on a 1 micron paramagnetic particle and 13
      nN on a 4.5 micron paramagnetic particle, forces over the full 4[pi] steradians, and a
      bandwidth in excess of 3 kHz while remaining compatible with a commercially available high NA
      microscope objective. This device has been combined with a feedback enhanced, high resolution
      (2.4nm), high bandwidth (10 kHz), long range (100 micron xyz range) laser tracking system. The
      design and testing of this instrument is discussed, as well as biological investigations that
      take full advantage of the instrument's capabilities. This dissertation concludes with the
      presentation of a technique that utilizes polymer dynamics to determine tension and polymer
      specific properties in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Future investigations involving
      this analysis technique will benefit greatly from the application of the manipulation device
      described in this dissertation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Asthma is the most common childhood chronic disease in this country. African- American
      children bear a disproportionate burden of asthma. Race-comparative studies suggest that
      African-American children are more likely to seek asthma treatment from emergency departments
      compared to White children. From the public health perspective, emergency department
      utilization for asthma care represents an adverse pediatric health outcome because many of
      these visits can be prevented. The research objectives of this dissertation were to
      investigate the effects of family adaptive resources, defined as psychosocial assets secured
      from the social environment, on pediatric asthma care utilization. Secondary data analyses of
      Phase One of the National Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study were conducted. Children of
      parents who self-identified as African-American and reported that a health care provider
      confirmed an asthma diagnosis were eligible for this study (n=1007). Independent variables
      included family adaptive resources, predisposing, enabling, and need factors, and family
      management behaviors. Asthma care utilization during the 9-month period following the baseline
      interview was measured as the number of emergency department visits and outpatient asthma care
      utilization. Analyses include negative binomial regression, multinomial logit regression, and
      mediation analysis. One-third of children completed one or more asthma ED visits. Surprising,
      all children with emergency department utilization also reported asthma visits to primary care
      providers. Compared to children of families with low emotional support, children whose
      caregiver perceived high availability emotional support had 31% fewer pediatric asthma
      emergency department visits (p &lt; .05). In addition, the caregiver's perception of
      having tangible aid in caring for the index child increased the probability that the child did
      not utilize any asthma-related services by 8 percentage points (p &lt; .05). Crime and
      employment-related stressors (past 12 month) also increased the likelihood of asthma emergency
      department utilization. This study provides support of the positive benefit of family adaptive
      resources in pediatric asthma outcomes.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study was done to examine the relationships among adiponectin and multiple risk
      factors for CVD and T2D in a large, racially diverse sample of youth, and to determine if
      relationships were moderated by gender, race and overweight status. The sample consisted of
      1215 Black and White children and adolescents, aged 7-18 years, selected from 2211 subjects
      who participated in the Cardiovascular Health in Children III Study. Subjects who were
      selected had frozen serum samples available for analysis, and had complete data on the
      following variables: race, age, gender, pubertal stage, cardiovascular fitness, high density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride,
      insulin, glucose, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), waist
      circumference, and sum of skinfolds. SAS 9.1.3 was used for all statistical analyses.
      Generalized Estimating Equations were used to account for the increased correlation among
      subjects within school clusters. Adiponectin means were lower in Black subjects and in male
      subjects overall, and specifically lower in Black males than in other race/gender groups.
      Adiponectin means were also lower in subjects with a family history of diabetes, but there
      were no differences in adiponectin means by Tanner stage or fitness level. BMI z-score, waist
      circumference and sum of skinfolds were each inversely related to adiponectin, but BMI z-score
      and waist circumference provided the best models for prediction of adiponectin when compared
      by the Quasi-Likelihood in Independence Model Criterion (QIC). Adiponectin was positively
      associated with HDL-C and inversely associated with insulin and systolic blood pressure in
      multivariate regression with other risk factors, but the relationships with insulin and
      systolic blood pressure were dependent on one or more measures of adiposity. There was an
      interaction between HDL-C and gender, in that the relationship between adiponectin and HDL-C
      was stronger in female than in males. Insulin was only related to adiponectin in female
      subjects. In summary, BMI z-score and waist circumference are strongly related to adiponectin.
      Race, gender and HDL-C are consistently related to adiponectin, independent of adiposity
      measures, but insulin and family history of diabetes are also important variables to consider
      in the study of adiponectin.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>For approximately 25 years, ablation of cardiac tissue by radiofrequency energy has
      been used to halt arrhythmic conduction in the heart. Efficacy of cardiac ablation for the
      treatment of atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias depends on the completeness of lesions
      and their ability to block arrhythmic conduction without disturbing sinus rhythm. A rapid
      index of lesion quality measured during surgical ablation procedures may improve the
      probability of long-term success in patients. Trans-lesion stimulus-excitation time delay was
      evaluated as an intraoperative indicator of lesion completeness. Time delay was shown to be
      significantly different for complete vs. incomplete lesions. Further, it was shown that
      activation path length corresponds with time delay, providing an explanation for post-ablation
      increases in time delay. Time delay of excitation measured on either side of a lesion having a
      small gap may increase after ablation, and then recover over time. This recovery would be
      important since the lesion may then be insufficient to suppress conduction. Although the
      Langendorff rabbit model used in this project is insufficient to observe long-term cardiac
      remodeling phenomena, short term recovery over tens of minutes post-ablation is practical with
      our apparatus. This would be useful for clinicians who may monitor time delay acutely in their
      patients before withdrawing the ablation probe. Complete recovery following initial
      trans-lesion block occurred within 5 minutes after ablation, while partial recovery occurred
      at 14.4 ± 1.0 minutes after ablation. Recovery of the activation complex occurred at 23.7 ±
      7.9 minutes after ablation. Hyperthermia affects the myocardium in a wide variety of ways,
      including denaturation of myofilaments, disruption of the sarcolemmal membrane and/or
      denaturation of membrane ion channels, alterations in cellular metabolism, and alterations in
      intracellular and transmembrane calcium handling. Depending on the extent of the hyperthermic
      damage sustained during ablation, gaps within lesions may recover following a return to
      physiological temperature. Conduction recovery may occur following initially successful lesion
      formation, and it may allow arrhythmic conduction to resume or may result in the formation of
      one or more new arrhythmias. Further, the temperature of tissue within a small gap of an
      ablation lesion may correlate with the recovery of myocytes within these gaps. Thus
      temperature monitoring of ablated tissue may be a useful supplement for monitoring block by
      measuring time delay. Temperatures within lesion gaps during complete recovery reached a
      maximum value of 63.44° C, while temperatures within lesions gaps during partial recovery
      reached a value of 52.7 ± 3.0° C. In lesions which did not show initial block, supernormal
      conduction was observed following ablation. Decreases in time delay of 17.8 ± 2.6% were
      observed, and minima of time delay occurred 28.0 ± 4.0 seconds after ablation. A relationship
      between temperature and time delay was observed in cases where supernormal conduction
      occurred, but a relationship was not observed in cases where post-ablation block occurred.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The P2Y family of G-protein coupled receptors are activated by adenine and uridine di-
      and triphosphate nucleotides and nucleotide sugars and are implicated in a wide range of
      important human physiologies. Difficulty studying these receptors and in their successful
      manipulation as therapeutic targets has historically derived from a lack of available
      pharmacological tools that discriminate among members of the P2Y receptor family. The studies
      described here focus on the P2Y1 receptor, a key mediator of ADP-induced platelet aggregation.
      Based on the structure of the recently synthesized, high-affinity P2Y1 receptorselective
      antagonist, 2-iodo-N6-methyl-(N)-methanocarba-2 -deoxyadenosine-3´,5´- bisphosphate (MRS2500),
      we undertook the development of a high-specific radioactivity radioligand for the P2Y1
      receptor, suitable for the study of endogenous receptors in mammalian tissues and cell lines.
      Using an enzymatic phosphorylation reaction, we successfully generated [32P]MRS2500 with a
      specific activity of 9120 Ci/mmol. The selectivity and affinity of [32P]MRS2500 for the P2Y1
      receptor were confirmed in radioligand binding assays with Sf9 insect cell membranes
      overexpressing recombinant P2Y1 receptors. The utility of [32P]MRS2500 for the study of
      endogenous P2Y1 receptors was examined using washed human platelets and membranes prepared
      from various tissues of the adult rat. We applied this high-specific radioactivity radioligand
      to observe surface expression of P2Y1 receptor binding sites in human platelets and MDCK(II)
      epithelial cells following incubation with P2Y1 receptor agonists. In human platelets, the
      rapid, agonist-promoted desensitization of the P2Y1 receptor observed after incubation with
      the selective agonist (N)- methanocarba-2-methylthioadenosine-diphosphate (MRS2365) also
      occurs for the Gqcoupled 5-HT2A receptor after incubation of platelets with
      5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). The rapid, agonist-promoted desensitization of the P2Y1 receptor
      of platelets was accompanied by a modest decrease (&lt; 20%) in the number of surface
      [32P]MRS2500 binding sites and only a partial recovery of P2Y1 receptor responsiveness after
      removal of the selective agonist MRS2365. Platelets, therefore, appear to employ a unique
      mechanism for prolonged termination of P2Y1 receptor signaling in which desensitized receptors
      are maintained at the cell surface, unable to respond to subsequent agonist stimulation. In
      intact MDCK(II) cells overexpressing recombinant P2Y1 receptors, incubation with 2MeSADP was
      followed by a 50% loss of surface [32P]MRS2500 binding sites that was agonist-concentration
      dependent and required the formation of clathrin-coated pits. Mutagenesis studies indicated
      that this rapid, agonist-promoted loss of surface binding sites requires two serine residues,
      Ser352 and Ser354, in the receptor carboxyl terminus. The findings presented here indicate
      that P2Y1 receptor cell surface expression is regulated in an agonist-dependent manner that
      differs in at least two cell types and suggests an important role for phosphorylation in
      agonist-dependent desensitization and internalization of the P2Y1 receptor.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The DDK syndrome is a polar early embryonic lethal phenotype that occurs when DDK
      females are mated to males of other inbred mouse strains. Lethality is parent of origin
      dependent and results from an incompatibility between an ooplasmic DDK factor and a non- DDK
      paternal gene, both of which map to the Ovum mutant (Om) locus on chromosome 11. Here, I
      utilize naturally occurring genetic variation in classical and wild-derived inbred strains to
      characterize the genetic architecture of the DDK syndrome. I show that genetic variation among
      wild-derived strains is uniformly distributed and significantly higher than previously
      reported for other mammalian species. The high levels of diversity present among laboratory
      strains suggests that the effective population size of the Mus lineage has been relatively
      large and constant over a long period of time. Overall, these findings demonstrate that
      wild-derived inbred strains are a valuable resource for genetic studies. By utilizing this
      resource in recombination mapping and association mapping experiments, we have reduced the
      candidate interval for the paternal gene of the DDK syndrome to a 23 kb region encompassing a
      single gene. We have also defined a candidate interval for the gene encoding the maternal
      factor, and demonstrated that the maternal and paternal components of the DDK syndrome are
      non-allelic. I have identified three Mus musculus domesticus wild-derived strains carrying
      modifiers that completely rescue the DDK syndrome lethality. In at least two of these strains,
      the major modifier loci are unlinked to Om and rescue lethality in a parent of origin
      dependent manner that is independent of allelic exclusion at Om. Taken together, these data
      reveal that the DDK syndrome requires a specific combination of alleles at multiple loci. The
      fact that all of these alleles, with the exception of the allele encoding the maternal DDK
      factor, segregate in natural populations of mice suggests that they may be part of an
      important molecular pathway. In conclusion, further characterization of the genes responsible
      for this rescue phenotype will not only provide significant insight into the DDK syndrome, it
      should also increase our understanding of the molecular framework underlying early mammalian
      development.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Timely and efficient destruction of proteins in the cell is critical for its normal
      function. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major pathway by which the cell targets
      proteins for degradation in a specific manner. Ubiquitination is a process in which ubiquitin
      is covalently conjugated to proteins via an enzymatic cascade composed of an E1 activating
      enzyme, an E2 conjugating enzyme and an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The cullins are a family of
      evolutionarily conserved proteins that assemble a large family of cullin-dependent E3 ligases
      (CDLs). A unique feature of CDLs is that the cullins, through a conserved N-terminal domain
      interact with a specificity factor - either directly or through an adaptor - to recruit
      specific substrates. This dissertation is directed toward understanding the mechanism by which
      CUL4 targets substrates. I show here that CUL4 utilizes an adaptor DDB1 (damaged DNA binding
      protein 1) and the specificity factor DWD (DDB1 binding and WD40 repeat) proteins to target
      various substrates. Specifically, a DNA pre-replicative licensing factor CDT1 is ubiquitinated
      and degraded by CUL4-DDB1-CDT2 ubiquitin ligase in response to DNA damage, thereby
      constituting a novel cell cycle G1-S checkpoint. Although the mechanistic role is not known,
      PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) is required for the ubiquitination of CDT1 catalyzed
      by CUL4-DDB1-CDT2. TSC2 (Tuberous Sclerosis complex) is an important tumor suppressor which
      plays an essential role inhibiting cell growth. The majority of disease-associated mutations
      targeting TSC2 results in a substantial decrease in protein level, suggesting that protein
      turnover plays a critical role in TSC regulation. In this study, I present the evidence
      indicating that CUL4-DDB1-FBW5 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase regulating TSC2 protein stability.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The molecular pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma is well-studied but not
      completely understood. We utilized a microcell-hybrid model approach to facilitate the
      identification of novel liver tumor suppressor genes located on human chromosome 11. These
      investigations confirmed a liver tumor suppressor locus at human chromosome 11p11.2, and
      subsequently identified SYT13 as the gene responsible for the suppression of tumorigenicity in
      rat liver tumor cell lines. Complementary approaches involving both silencing SYT13 in
      suppressed microcell-hybrid cell lines and expressing SYT13 in tumor cell lines showed that
      this gene is both required and sufficient for 11p11.2-mediated suppression of tumorigenicity
      in the GN6TF rat liver tumor cell line. Furthermore, the results strongly suggest that the
      dimerized form of the SYT13 protein is necessary for tumor suppressor function and that tumor
      suppression may be affected through pathways implicated in epithelial to mesenchymal
      transition. These observations also suggest that the deficit in GN6TF that leads to the
      tumorigenic phenotype involves loss of the ability of the endogenous Syt13 to dimerize,
      perhaps through protein misfolding or loss of post-translational processing.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation investigates the effects of transportation brokerage services on
      Medicaid beneficiaries' access to care. Medicaid pays for non-emergency medical transportation
      services to help vulnerable patients with transportation needs. The intended effect of
      transportation brokerage services is to provide reliable transportation at minimum costs. The
      study period from 1996 to 1999 corresponds to the period of a natural experiment during which
      Georgia and Kentucky implemented transportation brokerage services. Individual-level data were
      used to measure changes in use and expenditures of Medicaid services. Three study populations,
      which are transportation users, children with asthma, and adults with diabetes, were
      identified to capture possible effects. A difference-in-differences model was used to assess
      the effect of transportation brokerage services on Medicaid beneficiaries' access to care. The
      design is strengthened by the staggered implementation dates between states and within each
      state. Results show that the implementation of transportation brokerage services had
      significant effects on Medicaid beneficiaries' access to care, measured by Medicaid
      expenditures and health services use. The effects differed by type of Medicaid services and by
      medical conditions. Results for ambulatory care sensitive conditions admissions and ER use due
      to medical conditions suggest that adults with diabetes were better off under transportation
      brokerage services while the effects for children with asthma were inconclusive. Findings from
      this analysis could help guide policy modifications that support the reliable provision of
      non-emergency medical transportation services.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Mutation in the tumor suppressor gene, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), leads to the
      initiation of colon cancer. Both Drosophila and mammals have two APC family members, APC1 and
      APC2. Our lab and others have characterized both Drosophila family members in the developing
      embryonic epidermis. In addition, we characterized the expression of both in the developing
      larval brain. Construction of the brain is one of the most complex developmental challenges.
      Wnt signals shape all tissues, including the brain, and the APC is a key negative regulator of
      Wnt/Wingless (Wg) signaling. We carried out the first assessment of the role of APC proteins
      in brain development, simultaneously inactivating both APC1 and APC2 in clones of cells in the
      Drosophila larval optic lobe. Loss of both APCs triggers dramatic defects in optic lobe
      development. Double mutant cells segregate from wild-type neighbors to form epithelial
      "loops", while double mutant neurons form tangled axonal
      "knots", suggesting changes in cell adhesion. Activation of Wg signaling
      downstream of APC mimics these phenotypes, a dominant-negative TCF construct blocks them, and
      a known Wg target, Decapentaplegic, is activated in double mutant clones. These results
      strongly suggest that the phenotypes result from activated Wg signaling. We also explored the
      roles of classic cadherins in differential adhesion. Finally, we propose a model suggesting
      that Wg signaling regulates fine scale cell fates along the anterior-posterior axis in the
      developing larval brain, in part by creating an adhesion gradient.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics are inversely related to the prevalence and
      incidence of coronary heart disease, but little is known about their association with
      diabetes. We investigated whether neighborhood- and individual- level socioeconomic
      characteristics are associated with Type 2 diabetes prevalence and incidence and the
      prevalence of hyperinsulinemia and impaired fasting glucose, whether neighborhood associations
      persisted after adjusting for individual level social class indicators, and whether the
      effects of individual level indicators varied across neighborhoods. The study sample consisted
      of 10,721 African American and white men and women aged 45-64 at the baseline examination of
      the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. Participants were sampled from four United
      States communities: Forsyth County, North Carolina; Washington County, Maryland; the
      northwestern suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Jackson, Mississippi. Census tracts were
      used as proxies for neighborhoods. A summary score for neighborhood characteristics was
      constructed from indicators of wealth, income, education, and occupation from the 1990 U.S.
      Census. Age-adjusted multilevel models including neighborhood characteristics and individual
      level indicators (household income, education, and occupation) were fit separately for each
      race-gender group. Individual income, education, and occupation were inversely associated with
      diabetes prevalence for all race-gender subgroups. There were no clear, consistent patterns of
      association between individual level indicators and hyperinsulinemia and impaired fasting
      glucose. Individual level indicators were generally inversely associated with diabetes
      incidence in most subgroups, except among African American men, in whom education and
      occupation were directly associated with diabetes incidence. Neighborhood characteristics were
      inversely associated with the prevalence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose among women
      only. There was not a clear pattern of association between neighborhood characteristics and
      prevalence of hyperinsulinemia. Diabetes incidence was inversely related to neighborhood
      characteristics among whites only. There was a direct association for African American women
      and no clear pattern of association among African American men. Associations with individual
      level indicators did not vary systematically across neighborhoods. Individual level
      socioeconomic indicators generally were associated with diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, and
      impaired fasting glucose in this biracial cohort. Living in disadvantaged neighborhoods was
      not consistently associated with increased prevalence of diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, or
      impaired fasting glucose or incidence of diabetes.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, is a devastating
      disease that affects millions of people in the poor nations of sub-Saharan Africa. There is a
      great need for new treatments of this disease, as only four drugs are currently available, and
      all are associated with toxicity and other problems. The diamidine, pentamidine, has long been
      used for the treatment of trypanosomiasis, despite its toxicity and lack of knowledge of its
      mechanism of action. Drug development efforts have recently focused on creating less toxic,
      more potent diamidine derivatives of pentamidine with an orally bioavailable formulation.
      DB289, the prodrug of DB75, is in Phase III clinical trials as an oral treatment of HAT.
      Almost 2000 diamidines and related compounds have been synthesized, many with potent
      anti-trypanosomal activity. Although DB75 and other diamidines are potent DNA binders, the
      overall mechanism of action of this series of compounds is unknown. The focus of this research
      is to investigate diamidine accumulation and distribution in trypanosomes in vitro and in
      vivo. Diamidines such as DB75 accumulate to high concentrations in vitro and in vivo in
      trypanosomes, and localize to the kinetoplast and nucleus, which contain DNA, as well as the
      acidocalcisomes. The increase in treatment failures of anti-trypanosomal compounds has been a
      major concern in recent years, especially with melarsoprol. Several trypanosome lines have
      been developed which are resistant to DB75 in the laboratory, and methods developed to
      investigate intracellular accumulation and distribution were extended to these lines. These
      lines lack the P2 transporter, thought to be the main uptake transporter for DB75. DB75
      accumulation was lower in the resistant lines, with intracellular distribution also altered.
      Total accumulation, however, was substantial in these lines, despite lack of the major uptake
      transporter described for this compound. Benzofuran and benzimidazole diamidines were also
      investigated. The benzofuran series was found to accumulate in non-DNA containing organelles,
      which may represent a new mechanism of action for these diamidines. Together, the studies in
      this dissertation have proven that diamidines selectively accumulate in trypanosomes and that
      there is likely more than one mechanism of action for diamidines.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The liver is a possible target organ for exposure to particulate air pollution, which
      has been associated with acute and chronic cardiovascular effects. The studies contained
      within this dissertation evaluate the effects of ambient measures of PM10, NO2 and SO2 in
      relation to individual cholesterol parameters, LDL and HDL, in manuscript one, and alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT) levels in manuscript two. I employed multilevel analysis on individuals
      nested in counties in a nationally representative sample survey data merged with ambient air
      pollution monitoring data. I explored the contribution of the mean county and deviation from
      the mean county pollution levels to evaluate the independent contribution of aggregate and
      individual exposures on individual outcome parameters. In random intercepts models of LDL, a
      mean county average increase of 10[microgram]/dL of PM10 and 10 ppb of NO2 was associated with
      an increase of 4.26 mg/dL (95% CI: -1.57, 10.06) and 3.61 mg/dL (95% CI: 0.98,6.30). To the
      extent that individual level variation exists, the individual level pollutant estimates
      support the positive effect of PM10 and NO2 at the county level. Some evidence exists that the
      individual level effects of PM10 and SO2 are higher at higher county mean levels of air
      pollution. Log ALT levels are inversely related to PM10 exposure at both the county (-0.011;
      95% CI: -0.040, 0.017 ) and individual level ( -0.019 95% CI: -0.032, -0.005). The data
      suggest that log ALT is positively associated with county-level NO2 and though negative at
      mean county levels, the individual-level effect is more positive at higher county levels of
      NO2. Though the direction of these results is not consistent with hepatotoxicity, these
      results suggest alterations in liver metabolism that are shared with current cigarette smoking
      and may signify pathological changes in the liver. These data from around the country provide
      exposure contrasts that are evaluated against the alterations in the outcome measures at the
      appropriate level in the mixed models analysis. The cholesterol study provides evidence for a
      link between PM and atherosclerosis. The ALT study suggests a paradoxical relationship that
      may point to a meaningful alteration in metabolism with relevance to atherosclerosis.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Eukaryotic transcription requires the careful regulation of chromatin structure in
      order to allow access of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to DNA. Histone modifications are well
      established as regulators of chromatin structure and gene transcription. Although the
      influences of histone acetylation and phosphorylation have been investigated extensiviely, the
      role of histone methylation has recently become a topic of intense study in the field of
      chromatin biology. The newly discovered histone H3 methylase Set2 is the sole enzyme in yeast
      responsible for H3 lysine 36 (K36) methylation. Although earlier work suggested a role for
      Set2 and K36 methylation in transcriptional repression, the role of K36 methylation in yeast
      remained largely unexplored. Through the studies presented here, we have identified and
      characterized a link between Set2 and actively transcribing RNA polymerase II (RNAPII).
      Importantly, in Chapter 2 we present data identifying a novel domain in Set2 that is
      responsible for interaction with RNAPII. Further analysis of this domain revealed its presence
      in a number of Set2 homologues in other species, thereby stimulating further studies of the
      role of Set2 and K36 methylation in gene transcription across multiple organisms. In addition
      to studies of the downstream roles of Set2 and K36 methylation in transcription, in Chapter 3
      we describe our investigation into a network of proteins that are involved in the upstream
      regulation of Set2. These studies suggest an important link between the regulation of
      nucleosome conformation and subsequent K36 methylation, further supported by concurrent
      studies from other laboratories. Through our studies of Set2 and histone methylation, we also
      developed and improved several experimental methods that are presented in Chapter 4. Finally,
      in Chapter 5 we describe the contributions of our work in the larger context of recent studies
      from other laboratories. We also discuss relevant questions for future work regarding Set2 as
      well as histone modifications in general.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The specific host changes induced following viral infection are reflective of the
      complex interaction occurring between pathogen and host. These changes are often evident in a
      cascade of altered transcription patterns. However, the elucidation of such cascades in vivo
      has been limited by a general inability to distinguish changes occurring within the minority
      of infected cells from that in surrounding uninfected cells. Therefore, an innovative
      mRNP-tagging system was employed to isolate host mRNA specifically from infected cells
      following Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) infection. To dissect the contributions
      of autocrine and paracrine signaling events, simultaneous total RNA analysis was utilized in
      conjunction with this novel approach to directly analyze the infected cell response. The
      result was a multifaceted profile of the early response to VEE in primary dendritic cells, as
      well as within the initially targeted tissue in vivo, the draining lymph node. A two-phase
      innate response to infection was revealed, in which the activation of host genes within
      infected cells led to the activation of surrounding bystander cells. To further determine the
      impact of this robust innate immune response on the entire animal, we utilized VEE replicon
      particles (VRP) to limit infection in vivo to the initially infected cells, and examined the
      host antiviral response within tissues distal to the site of replication. Although these
      remote tissues had not encountered VRP, they nevertheless were exposed to high levels of
      soluble immune modulators, including serum interferon. In the liver and brain, the rapid
      activation of a panel of interferon-stimulated genes was detected by 3h following VRP footpad
      inoculation, reaching peak expression levels of greater than 100-fold over mock. Moreover,
      mice receiving a footpad VRP inoculation 6, 12, or 24h prior to an otherwise lethal VEE
      challenge were completely protected from death. The results presented here document the rapid
      modulation of the host innate response within hours of pathogen invasion, a response that is
      capable of transforming the entire infected animal, and largely determining the outcome of
      infection.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous human herpesvirus that is associated with the
      development of lymphoid and epithelial malignancies including Hodgkin lymphoma (HD),
      post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and
      others. Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is the EBV oncogene as it is necessary for
      EBV-mediated transformation of B-lymphocytes and can itself transform rodent fibroblasts. LMP1
      has a short amino-terminal cytoplasmic end, 6 transmembrane domains, and a long
      carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail that contains the two signaling domains, the
      carboxyl-terminal activation regions 1 and 2 (CTAR1 and CTAR2). Through CTAR1 and CTAR2, LMP1
      activates several signaling pathways including NF[kappa]B, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
      (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways.
      In this study, CTAR1 was shown to be necessary for Rat-1 fibroblast transformation and
      activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, whereas CTAR2 was dispensable. LMP1-mediated rodent
      fibroblast transformation did not require I[kappa]B[alpha]-dependent activation of NF[kappa]B.
      Seven sequence variants of LMP1 have been identified: Alaskan, B95.8, China 1, China 2, Med+,
      Med-, and NC. The frequency of detection of these variants differs in various EBV-associated
      malignancies from different geographic regions. In this study, all the sequence variants were
      demonstrated to transform Rat-1 fibroblasts, induce increased motility of human foreskin
      keratinocytes, induce homotypic adhesion of BJAB cells and activate the PI3K-Akt signaling
      pathway. The Alaskan, China 1 and Med+ variants had limited binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase
      component HOS and enhanced NF[kappa]B signaling. These findings indicate that the signature
      amino acid changes of the LMP1 variants do not hinder or significantly enhance their in vitro
      transforming potential or signaling properties. Finally, dominant negative forms of TRAF2 and
      TRAF3 inhibited LMP1-mediated transformation of rodent fibroblasts. Activation of PI3K-Akt
      signaling and deregulation of cell-cycle markers were mapped to the TRAF-binding site and
      residues between CTAR1 and CTAR2. Activation of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway through
      the TRAF-binding site was required for LMP1-induced transformation of rodent fibroblasts.
      These findings identify a signaling pathway that is uniquely activated by CTAR1.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The yeast S. cerevisiae must respond to a wide variety of external stimuli with the
      appropriate differential program to ensure survival. Yeast cells transmit signals from
      external environmental cues via signaling cascades to bring about proper transcriptional
      programs. One such signaling cascade, the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade, is
      conserved in all organisms. The MAPK cascade that contains the sequentially acting kinases
      Ste20, Ste11, Ste7 and Kss1 is used in both filamentous growth differentiation in response to
      limiting nutrients as well as differentiation in response to mating pheromone. Despite the
      shared components signaling fidelity remains. The central kinase in both the mating and
      filamentous growth differentiation pathways is Ste7. We used a constitutively active version
      of this kinase to examine if biological specificity is lost by removing the need for external
      stimulus. We found that the constitutively active Ste7 promoted filamentous growth while
      simultaneously failing to support mating differentiation. One version of constitutively active
      Ste7 that could not be feedback phosphorylated in a MAPK dependent manner was unable to bind
      to the MAPK Fus3 but retained the ability to bind to Ste5 and Kss1. Despite being able to bind
      to Ste5 this version of Ste7 was unable to activate Fus3 but retained the ability to activate
      Kss1. The activation of Kss1 by constitutively active Ste7 is independent of the scaffold
      protein Ste5. Unlike Kss1, Fus3 activation requires Ste5. We isolated a substitution mutation
      variant of Ste7 that was impaired for binding to Ste5 but not impaired for activation of the
      transcriptional reporter gene for filamentous growth. This variant of Ste7 neither activated
      Fus3 nor supported mating differentiation in response to pheromone. Yeast cells expressing
      this variant of Ste7 displayed higher levels of phosphorylated Mpk1, the MAPK that functions
      in response to plasma membrane distortions. Our findings uncovered a role for Ste5 in
      maintaining signal specificity by allowing for specific activation of Fus3 by Ste7 in response
      to mating pheromone. We also uncovered a novel role that Mpk1 may play in the transcriptional
      response during filamentous growth. These data suggest MAPK signaling occurs through a network
      rather than linear pathways.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>During development, the expression states of many genes must be maintained through
      cell divisions in order to ensure lineage-, time-, and dose-appropriate patterns of gene
      expression. This transcriptional memory is independent of permanent DNA sequences changes and
      instead involves reversible epigenetic mechanisms. Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins represent a
      conserved family of developmental regulators that mediate heritable transcriptional silencing
      by covalently modifying histone proteins. Here, we demonstrate that mutations in the PcG gene
      Embryonic ectoderm development (Eed) produce a variety of epigenetic defects in mouse embryos
      and stem cells. EED is a noncatalytic subunit of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, a 600 kDa
      complex containing a number of proteins, including the histone H3-lysine 27 (H3K27)
      methyltransferase EZH2. Consistent with the role of PcG genes in transcriptional memory, Eed
      mutant embryos and trophoblast stem cells have defects in genomic imprinting, a process by
      which an allele's expression is dependent upon the gender of the parent from which it was
      inherited. To determine whether these gene expression defects revealed a required role for EED
      in PRC2 function, we characterized the status of H3K27 methylation in Eed mutant stem cells.
      H3K7 can be mono-, di-, or trimethylated (H3K27me1, H3K27me2, H3K27me3, respectively), but it
      has been unclear which of these marks are mediated by PRC2. Here, we demonstrate that EED is
      required for all three methylation states. Additionally, although EED is present as four
      distinct isoforms in mammalian cells, these isoforms are not necessary for H3K27 methylation.
      Instead, EED's core WD-40 motifs and histone binding domain alone are sufficient to mediate
      histone methylation. Finally, although the histone methylation defects in Eed mutant stem
      cells appear to be global, the imprinted expression defects are restricted to DNA
      hypomethylated, extraembryonic tissues and to genes that are imprinted normally in DNA
      methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) mutant placentas. Together, these results suggest that histone
      methylation and DNA methylation may have non-overlapping roles in imprinted gene regulation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>A statewide campaign to reduce youth tobacco use has resulted in 78 of North
      Carolina's 115 school districts adopting a 100% Tobacco-free school policy (TFS). Research was
      conducted to determine whether three dimensions of policy implementation - policy
      communication, compliance monitoring, and policy enforcement - were associated with student
      smoking, and to elucidate the policy implementation process in middle and high schools across
      the state. Sixty-five principals from middle and high schools that had a 100% TFS policy and
      that had participated in the 2005 Youth Tobacco Survey (YTS) completed a survey of their
      schools' implementation of the 100% TFS policy. Using data from the survey, overall
      implementation ratings (IRs) that demonstrated the level of policy implementation of the 100%
      TFS policy at each school were created. The IRs were based on the schools' achievement of a
      set of eight objectives related to the three dimensions of policy implementation. The average
      school IR was 7.05 out of 9.0, with a range of 4.8 - 9.0. No correlation between IRs and
      current student smoking was found. Multiple regression was used to explore whether the
      communication, compliance monitoring, and enforcement subscale scores of the IR predicted the
      current student smoking rate at the school. A moderate positive association was found between
      the current student smoking rate and the communication subscale of the implementation rating.
      Further analysis was conducted on the various subscales. A one-way analysis of variance found
      a positive relationship between the amount of time that that a school has had a policy in
      place and the level of compliance monitoring at the school. Three categories of policy
      compliance violations were also analyzed: (a) the number of policy violations reported by the
      principal for the academic year, (b) student reports of smoking on campus or at campus events
      in the 30 days prior to taking the survey, and (c) student reports of school staff smoking on
      campus or at school events in the thirty days prior to taking the survey. A small negative
      correlation was found between the IR and the total number of policy violations for the
      academic year (as reported by principals) at both high schools and middle schools and a
      moderate negative correlation was found between the enforcement subscale and the number of
      policy violations at middle schools. A moderate negative correlation was also found between
      the percentage of students who reported smoking on school property or at school events and the
      communication subscale for both middle and high schools. Finally, a moderate negative
      correlation was found between the percentage of high school students who report seeing school
      staff smoke on campus or at campus-related events and the overall IR and the compliance
      monitoring subscale. Less than half of the schools offered education or remediation for
      students who were caught violating the school's tobacco policy. Eight key informant interviews
      were also conducted to identify community, organizational and individual factors that affect
      policy implementation. Factors that facilitated or hindered policy implementation included:
      attitudes of school principals, leadership and support, and resource availability or
      constraints. This research identified a need to provide support and resources to principals,
      school district leaders, and community stakeholders to improve or maintain already high levels
      of implementation in order to achieve the primary policy goal of reducing youth tobacco use.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) is a naturally emerging disease threat and
      a previously developed biological weapon, making it an important pathogen of the Alphavirus
      family. Unfortunately, little is known about how the viral proteins interact with the host
      cell at the molecular level. The viral nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2), a required member of
      the alphavirus replication complex, has undefined activities that are critical in determining
      the outcome of alphavirus infection. To gain insight into auxiliary functions of nsP2,
      cellular proteins in the mammalian host cell with which nsP2 interacted were examined. In VEE
      and other alphaviruses, nsP2 is associated with ribosomal protein S6 (RpS6), an essential
      component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. The interaction of RpS6 with nsP2 occurred throughout
      the course of infection and did not require the presence of the other viral proteins.
      Moreover, reducing the cellular level of RpS6 protein caused diminished expression from
      alphavirus subgenomic messages, whereas it did not dramatically alter cellular translation.
      The subcellular localization of VEE nsP2 was examined in order to gain insight into its
      activity in the mammalian host cell. VEE nsP2 was found both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus
      of mammalian cells during infection and also when expressed in the absence of other viral
      proteins. The C-terminal third of VEE nsP2 can localize EGFP exclusively to the nucleus of
      mammalian cells, and contains the sequence PGKMV, which is homologous to the nuclear
      localization signal of Semliki Forest virus nsP2. Mutation in this sequence diminished, but
      did not eliminate, localization to the nucleus, suggesting that this sequence contributes to
      the nuclear localization of VEE nsP2. Furthermore, VEE nsP2 specifically interacted with the
      nuclear import protein karyopherin-[alpha] 1, suggesting that during infection nsP2 is
      transported to the nucleus by karyopherin-[alpha] 1. Additionally, a novel leucine-rich
      nuclear export signal was identified in VEE nsP2, and nuclear export mediated by this signal
      occurred via the CRM1 pathway. Taken together, these results establish that nsP2 interacts
      with essential cellular components and is actively directed to multiple subcellular
      compartments, suggesting that nsP2 mediates a critical interplay of the virus with the host
      cell.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The ErbB signaling network regulates many critical biological processes. This network
      consists of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and three related receptors and a
      superfamily of growth factor ligands. Signaling is initiated when EGF-like polypeptide ligands
      bind to EGFR, ErbB3 or ErbB4, causing receptor homo- or heterodimerization between the four
      related receptor tyrosine kinases, including the orphan receptor ErbB2. The EGF-like family of
      growth factors include: epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-[alpha]
      (TGF-[alpha]), amphiregulin (AR), heparin binding-epidermal growth factor (HBEGF) betacellulin
      (BTC), epiregulin (EPR), epigen (EPI). The growth factors binding to ErbB receptors are
      produced as membrane anchored precursors that can be proteolytically cleaved in the
      extracellular juxtamembrane domain to release mature, soluble ligands, in a process termed
      ectodomain shedding. Metalloproteases, in particular the family of disintegrin and
      metalloproteases (ADAMs) have been identified as the proteases responsible for the shedding of
      diverse cell surface proteins. Efforts to understand the regulation of growth factor shedding
      led to the discovery of ADAM17, or tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] converting enzyme (TACE), as
      the major sheddase for the ErbB ligands. Evidence came from biochemical and in vivo studies,
      including mice lacking functional TACE due to a deletion in the metalloprotease domain.
      Homozygous TACE-deficient animals displayed perinatal lethality similar to EGFR-null mice and
      revealed subtle phenotypes that mimicked single growth factor null mice such as delayed eyelid
      closure like TGF-[alpha] deficient mice, heart and lung defects seen in the absence of HB-EGF
      and mammary gland development issues found in AR null creatures. Despite the recognition of a
      key role for TACE in development, understanding of the regulation mechanisms are incomplete.
      Several findings point to a role for MAPK pathways, non-receptor tyrosine kinases, calcium and
      calcium-dependent kinases and reactive oxygen species. The work described here identifies a
      pathway initiated by ATP binding to the P2Y family of GPCRs that mediates TACE-dependent
      TGF-[alpha] shedding and concomitant EGFR activation. Transactivation offers a physiologically
      relevant pathway to examine the mechanism of TACE regulation, which I use to identify
      mitochondria as a source of the key signaling intermediate in TACE activation, reactive oxygen
      species.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The results of most HIV-prevention programs over the 25-year history of the AIDS
      epidemic have been disappointing. Two interventions have been notable exceptions in the string
      of prevention failures: in 1983, researchers reported that consistent use of male condoms
      reduced risk of HIV transmission, and much more recently, in February 2007, large-scale
      randomized trials determined that circumcision reduced men's risk of HIV acquisition by
      40-65%. These separate interventions - male circumcision and condom use - are the focus of
      these dissertation analyses. We examined whether the circumcision status of women's primary
      sexual partner was associated with her risk of HIV and three sexually transmitted infections
      (STIs): Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC), and Trichomonas vaginalis
      (Tv). We used data from a prospective cohort study on hormonal contraception and incident HIV
      and STI (HC-HIV study) among women from Uganda, Zimbabwe and Thailand (HIV analyses included
      4,417 Ugandan and Zimbabwean women; STI analyses included 5,925 women from Uganda, Zimbabwe
      and Thailand). After adjustment, women with circumcised partners had similar risk to women
      with uncircumcised partners for HIV (hazard ratio (HR): 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI):
      0.69-1.53), Ct (HR: 1.22, 95% CI: 0.94-1.59), GC (HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.70-1.24), and Tv (HR:
      1.05, 95% CI: 0.81-1.37). Among women who became HIV-infected during HC-HIV, we also examined
      whether HIV diagnosis, together with counseling and free condoms, was sufficient to induce
      changes in women's condom use over both short (2-6 months) and longer time periods (12-16
      months). After diagnosis, the number of HIV-infected women reporting any unprotected acts in a
      typical month declined significantly (short-term: from 72% to 56%; long-term: from 74% to
      56%). After adjustment, among women reporting any unprotected acts, HIV-infected women also
      reduced the number of unprotected acts by 29% (short term) and 38% (long term). When assessing
      the proportion of acts where male condoms were used, however, women had no reduction over
      time. Circumcision was not associated with women's risk of HIV, Ct, Tv or GC among most
      participants. HIV-infected women reduced their overall number of unprotected sex acts, but the
      proportion of unprotected acts was unchanged from pre-infection behavior.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Breast cancer represents a significant health problem and improvements in our ability
      to prevent, diagnose, and treat the disease requires a greater understanding of the molecular
      basis of breast carcinogenesis. Epigenetic mechanisms play a major role in breast
      carcinogenesis, with DNA methylation accounting for most epigenetic gene silencing, affecting
      a number of different gene targets. However, mechanisms of DNA methylationdependent silencing
      are poorly understood. To identify epigenetically-regulated genes in breast cancer, MCF-7
      breast cancer cells were exposed to demethylating treatment and gene expression patterns were
      examined by microarray analysis. Genes with increased expression after demethylation treatment
      that returned to control levels after treatment withdrawal were directly assessed for DNA
      methylation by bisulfite sequencing. A group of 20 putative methylation-sensitive genes were
      identified that could be classified into three groups based upon their promoter CpG features.
      The majority of these methylation-sensitive genes lacked a conventional DNA methylation target
      (CpG island), resulting in an expanded model for epigenetic regulation of gene expression that
      recognizes the importance of all promoter CpGs. The breast tumor suppressor gene CST6
      (Cystatin M) is epigenetically silenced in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. CST6 is subject to
      methylation-dependent regulation in multiple breast cancer cell lines, primary breast tumors,
      and lymph node metastases, and gene expression status correlates with promoter
      hypermethylation. These results suggest that methylation dependent gene silencing of CST6
      represents an important mechanism for loss of CST6 during breast carcinogenesis. The
      mechanisms that control CpG island methylation are poorly understood. CST6 was utilized as an
      index gene for the identification of cis elements that direct promoter CpG methylation. The
      methylation-sensitive CST6 promoter was assembled into luciferase reporter constructs and
      transfected into model breast cancer cell lines that methylate or do not methylate the CST6
      promoter. Truncation of the CST6 promoter disassociated a putative instructional cis
      regulatory sequence located in the 5' upstream promoter region of CST6 that functions to
      direct CpG methylation. The observations and results described in this dissertation
      significantly advance our understanding of methylation-sensitive genes and mechanisms
      governing DNA methylation in breast carcinogenesis.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The science of toxicology is directed toward understanding the mechanisms by which
      environmental agents cause adverse health effects in humans. Traditional methodologies to
      assess toxicity have relied on observable adverse effects which have proven to be useful
      diagnostic indicators; however, frequently they do not provide mechanistic insight necessary
      to unravel the complex biological networks responsible for the development of disease.
      Toxicogenomics, a sub-discipline of toxicology which examines the global genomic response of
      organisms to a toxic insult, when applied in parallel with classical toxicological endpoints
      can advance the field by providing molecular markers of exposure and response, and defining
      disease processes. Thus, we hypothesize that molecular signatures defining disease mechanisms
      and early effects of exposure can be phenotypically anchored to biomarkers of oxidative stress
      and DNA damage. In Aim 1, a molecular signature of incipient toxicity for an acute sub-toxic
      dose of acetaminophen was phenotypically anchored to oxidative stress markers based on its
      mechanism of hepatotoxicity. The detection of early changes in a biologic process at doses and
      times with no apparent clinical signs of toxicity provides an improved basis to develop
      predictive markers of effect. In Aim 2, molecular signatures were identified that temporally
      modeled disease pathology and oxidative stress for a choline-deficient model of rodent
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Measures of oxidative DNA damage established a temporal
      linkage between fibrosis and accumulation of DNA lesions, processes that may contribute to
      hepatocyte transformation. Moreover, comparison of rat and human HCC expression profiles,
      regardless of etiology, demonstrated that advanced stages of liver disease converge onto a
      common and indistinguishable phenotype. In Aim 3, gene expression profiling combined with
      measures of oxidative stress established that dietary fatty acids can have a profound yet
      differential effect on oxidative stress in the liver mediated by their ability to activate
      PPAR[alpha]. Many environmental exposures exhibit human toxicity and disease through
      oxidative-stress signaling pathways. Thus, dietary fatty acids can markedly influence
      sensitivity or resistance to disease. In summary, toxicogenomics moves the field of toxicology
      beyond traditional approaches by linking the critical molecular events caused by exposure to
      environmental factors with disease.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>With advances in medication therapy, HIV has become a chronic illness successfully
      treated provided the patient is able to achieve adherence with the prescribed anti-retroviral
      medication regimen. The numbers of new HIV cases each year are increasing in women, especially
      women of color. Moreover, the rates of infection for incarcerated women are double that of
      incarcerated men. Incarcerated women frequently come from environments burdened with violence,
      substance and physical abuse, homelessness, child-care issues and mental illness. Such burdens
      negatively impact the ability of the women to adhere to the medication plan. The purpose of
      this study was to explore incarcerated HIV positive women's beliefs of the barriers and
      facilitators to ART adherence, the role of healthcare provider relationships with adherence
      and how issues of medical privacy influence ability or desire to adhere while incarcerated.
      Through qualitative exploratory, descriptive inquiry, a secondary analysis using a
      pre-existing set of interviews with HIV positive female inmates was conducted to determine the
      answers to the research questions. Factors identified influencing ART adherence were the
      medication line, stigma, the routine, administration choice (directly observed therapy or keep
      own prescription), a relationship with the healthcare provider, policies within the prison,
      education and medical privacy.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Soils at hazardous waste sites contain complex mixtures of chemicals and are often
      difficult to characterize in terms of risk to human and ecological health. Over time,
      biogeochemical processes can decrease the apparent concentrations of pollutants, but can also
      lead to accumulation of new products whose toxicity and behavior in the environment are often
      not considered. The first part of this study evaluated the toxicity of two bacterial
      transformation products of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pyrene-4,5-quinone (P45Q)
      and fluoranthene-2,3-quinone (F23Q). Both quinones caused oxidative DNA damage in vitro by the
      production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hydrogen peroxide and copper were essential for
      causing oxidative DNA damage. F23Q was toxic to HeLa S3 cells, but did not produce measurable
      levels of ADL or base oxidation. P45Q caused both ADL and base oxidation in cells. Neocuproine
      reduced the amount of ADL caused by P45Q, indicating that copper was still important for the
      intracellular generation of damaging oxidants. P45Q is a novel metabolite and its effects on
      DNA have not previously been investigated. To assess the significance of redox-active
      bacterial metabolites on the toxicity of PAH-contaminated soil, a bioassay-directed
      fractionation technique was employed for the detection of mutagens in organic soil extracts.
      The bacterial tryptophan reverse mutation assay with E. coli WP2 uvrA/pKM101 (IC188) and E.
      coli WP2 uvrA oxyR/pKM101 (IC203) was used to screen fractions for genotoxicity. Strain IC203
      carries the [delta]oxyR30 mutation which prevents the expression of anti-oxidant proteins in
      response to oxidative stress and increases its reversion by ROS-generating compounds. Polar
      fractions of PAH-contaminated soil extracts were mutagenic to strain IC203, but not to the
      OxyR-proficient strain, IC188. Catalase was able to reduce IC203 reversion, further
      implicating the involvement of reactive oxygen species. Oxidized PAHs, including quinones,
      were identified in the mutagenic fractions, but were not by themselves mutagenic to either
      strain. Transition metals were detected in mutagenic as well as non-mutagenic fractions, but
      no clear relationship between metal content and oxidative mutagenicity could be established
      from the data. Interactions between chemicals or complex organic molecules may have
      contributed to the oxidative mutagenicity of the fractions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation attempts to provide a comprehensive understanding about the impacts
      of state minimum staffing standards and to determine unbiased estimates of the effect of
      staffing on quality of nursing home care. Specifically, by exploiting differences in the
      timing of staffing standard changes for the 50 states and the District of Columbia from 1998
      to 2001, this study conducts three empirical analyses to examine (1) the total effects of
      staffing standards on staffing choices and on quality of care, (2) the total effect of
      staffing standards on financial performance, and (3) the underlying (causal) relationship
      between staffing and quality of care. The major findings are as follows: (1) Increases in
      staffing standards matter particularly for the subset of nursing homes with staffing level
      previously below or close to new standards, whereas the results show consistent beneficial
      effects for the rate of restraint use and the number of total deficiencies at all types of
      facilities. (2) Increases in staffing standards have significant negative impacts on total
      margin at nonprofit facilities with relatively low staffing. (3) When endogeneity of staffing
      is taken into account, the results support the persistent beneficial effects of increasing
      total staff hours on the onset of pressure sores, contractures, and catheter use. The analyses
      performed in this dissertation are particularly relevant to the era of growth in the aged
      population and provides important policy implications. Structural differences in nursing home
      behavior in response to increased staffing standards suggest that future policy should be
      developed by emphasizing on stragetic planning and operative management of scarce labor
      resources to achieve both better quality and greater efficiency. In order to achieve the
      benefits of mandatory staffing standards, the federal and state governments should determine
      the additional costs and develop a plan to adequately fund the required increases in staffing
      levels. The monitoring and enforcement of federal and state laws and regulations are
      necessary. Lastly, the findings suggest that differences in financial performance may result
      in differences in quality produced and vice versa. An integrative perspective which explores
      the relationship between quality and financial performance may be insightful in the future
      research.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Cell cycle progression from G1 to S-phase depends on phosphorylation of pRb by
      complexes containing a cyclin (D-type or E-type) and cyclin-dependent kinase (e.g. cdk2, cdk4,
      or cdk6). Growth arrest is achieved by activation of the Arf-p53 pathway, or through
      activation of Ink4 family proteins, which specifically inhibit the activity of cyclin D-cdk4/6
      complexes. We employed genetic and pharmacologic approaches to study the roles of the Ink4
      family of proteins and the Arf-p53 pathway in regulating proliferation of cultured murine
      embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and murine tissues. While the loss of the Ink4 genes p16Ink4a and
      p18Ink4c did not affect growth kinetics of MEFs despite an increase in cdk4 activity,
      reduction of Arf mRNA and protein through genetic inactivation or culture at 3% oxygen
      resulted in immortalization. The decrease in Arf mRNA at 3% O2 was due to reduced mRNA
      stability, which was regulated by the 3'UTR of the Arf transcript. However, Arf was still
      functional at 3% O2, as senescence could be induced through over-expression of oncogenic Ras,
      which increased Arf mRNA levels. In contrast to the lack of effect of p16Ink4a and p18Ink4c
      loss on MEFs, in vivo, germline deficiency of p16Ink4a and p18Ink4c resulted in increased
      proliferation in the intermediate pituitary and pancreatic islets of adult mice, and survival
      of p16Ink4a-/-; p18Ink4c-/- mice was significantly reduced due to aggressive pituitary tumors.
      Compensation among the Ink4 proteins was observed both in vivo in p18Ink4c -/- mice and in
      MEFs from p16Ink4a -/-, p18Ink4c -/- or p16Ink4a -/-; p18Ink4c -/- mice. Treatment with PD
      0332991, a specific cdk4/6 kinase inhibitor, abrogated proliferation in those compartments
      where Ink4-deficiency was associated with enhanced proliferation: islets, pituitary and
      B-lymphocytes, but had no effect on proliferation in other tissues such as the small bowel.
      These data suggest that while Arf is the dominant regulator of proliferation in MEFs, p16Ink4a
      and p18Ink4c have a significant in vivo role in coordinately regulating the catalytic activity
      of cdk4/6 in specific compartments of adult mice. In addition, these data demonstrate a novel,
      oxygen-dependent mechanism of the regulation of senescence by the Ink4a/Arf locus.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Background: At present, high-risk sexual practices and reproductive health problems
      are increasingly evident among Thai adolescents. School-based sex education is one strategy to
      address these problems. Despite rapid westernization in Thailand, sexual matters are still
      culturally taboo. Thus, perspectives of Thais toward adolescents' sexual behaviors and
      school-based sex education are not well understood. Objectives: 1) To explore the perspective
      of stakeholders toward adolescents' sexual behaviors and an existing school-based sex
      education curriculum; and 2) To recommend an appropriate school-based sex education curriculum
      that takes into account viewpoints at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational,
      community and policy levels. Methodology: This study is based on the descriptive approach to
      qualitative research. Data were collected from middle and high school students, parents,
      teachers, school administrators, community leaders, and provincial government authorities from
      January 4 to July 28, 2006. A total of 90 individuals participated in 28 in-depth interviews,
      12 focus group interviews, and 3 classroom observations. Content analysis was used to analyze
      study data. Results: Thai adolescents engage in various kinds of sexual behaviors. Media and
      technology are considered by study participants as the greatest influence on these sexual
      behaviors. Most Thai adults in this study were accepting of adolescents' sexual behaviors such
      as having a boyfriend or girlfriend and accessing sexually explicit media but not premarital
      sex. They were also aware of reproductive health problems among adolescents. However, they
      perceived these problems as family-level problems. All participants supported school-based sex
      education yet articulated both benefits and costs. Based on stakeholders' recommendations, the
      appropriate curriculum should emphasize abstinence-only and also provide education about safe
      sex practices. Morality and Thai culture should also be taught simultaneously. Current
      school-based sex education is perceived to need improvement in: curriculum, teachers, and the
      school environment. Conclusion: School-based sex education is recognized as an appropriate
      strategy to reduce unhealthy sexual behaviors and to promote reproductive health among Thai
      adolescents.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Chromatin plays a dynamic role in regulating gene transcription. Regulation of
      accessibility of DNA template is mediated in part by nucleosome occupancy such that
      nucleosomes are relatively depleted upstream of genes and relatively enriched in the coding
      regions. One of the factors that influence this differential nucleosome occupancy is histone
      post translational modifications. One such modification is dimethylation of histone H3 at
      Lysine 36 (H3K36me2). It is mediated by Set2, a histone methyl transferase (HMT) in yeast
      which had been shown to associate with RNA polymerase II (RNA pol-II) during transcription
      elongation at individual loci. To study the role of Set2 in gene regulation, I sought to
      determine the genome wide localization of H3K36me2. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation
      followed by DNA microarray hybridization (ChIP-chip), we show that H3K36me2 is predominantly
      localized to RNA pol-II transcribed regions and is depleted in the regulatory (promoter)
      regions genome-wide. Mating loci, telomeres, RNA pol-III transcribed regions have scarce or
      low levels of H3K36me2. H3K36me2 modification begins within RNA pol-II transcribed ORFs at
      approximately same location, independent of the length of the ORF. This further confirms that
      Set2 associates with RNA pol-II after the initiation phase of transcription. Levels of
      H3K36me2 do not correlate with the transcriptional frequencies of genes. However, genes that
      are transcribed at some detectably level tend to have higher levels of H3K36me2 than genes
      that are completely repressed. H3K36me2 therefore acts as a mark that demarcates coding and
      regulatory regions. The function of such a mark became clear with the finding by other groups
      that localization of Set2 and H3K36me2 at coding regions was essential for maintaining the
      fidelity of transcriptional initiation. Absence of Set2 leads to hyperacetylation in the
      coding regions and, as a consequence, aberrant initiation events. My studies show that
      H3K36me2 is a chromatin mark that demarcates functionally distinct regions of the genome by
      marking the coding regions specifically. Studies by others show that this localization of
      H3K36me2 is important for maintaining proper chromatin structure. H3 Lysine 36 is also
      acetylated and ChIP-chip analysis showed that H3K36ac is enriched in the promoter regions in
      the entire yeast genome. The function of H3K36ac is not yet known but it is possible that one
      way H3K36me2 is restricted to the coding regions by acetylating this residue in the regulatory
      regions. Another way organisms demarcate specific functional boundaries is by restricting tri
      methyl Lysine 4 at histone H3 (H3K4me3) to the 5' end of coding regions. Ctk1, a kinase that
      has been shown to phosphorylate Serine 2 of C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA pol-II was shown to
      regulate the levels of H3K4me3. Ctk1 is required for the recruitment of Set2 to RNA pol-II. My
      genome wide studies show that absence of Ctk1 causes spreading of H3K4me3 into the 3' region
      of ORFs globally resulting in disruption of chromatin structure within the ORFs and occurrence
      of aberrant transcription initiation. These studies show that specific histone modification
      patterns are important for maintaining chromatin structure. Organisms have developed multiple
      mechanisms to ensure proper localization of these modifications disruption of which could
      cause disturbances in transcriptional programs.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Metabolic syndrome (defined by three or more of the following traits: elevated
      triglycerides, low HDL, abdominal overweight, elevated fasting plasma glucose, and elevated
      blood pressure) has been linked to an increased risk of type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular
      disease. Cook and colleagues (2003) demonstrated that Mexican American have the highest
      prevalence of metabolic syndrome among adolescents. Thus, understanding the factors associated
      with an elevated risk for metabolic syndrome in this population is paramount. This study
      examines the role of acculturation on the risk of metabolic syndrome and its antecedents,
      physical activity and dietary intake, in Mexican-American adolescents. A pooled cross-section
      (N=1831) of adolescents (12-19 yrs.) was taken from the NHANES 1999-2002. Logistic and linear
      regression models were used to examine the relationships between acculturation and metabolic
      syndrome, physical activity, and dietary intake controlling for other known correlates. The
      overall prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 4.8% or approximately 1.5 million U.S.
      adolescents. Mexican American ethnicity, overweight, gender, and inactivity, were associated
      with a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Mexican-American adolescents were more likely
      to be overweight and inactive compared to Caucasians. Acculturation did not have a direct
      association with metabolic syndrome, but higher levels of acculturation were associated with
      increased physical activity and increased daily intake of calories, carbohydrates, saturated
      fat, and the number of times eating meals outside the home. Mexican American males were the
      most likely to have metabolic syndrome. Acculturation seems to be playing a role in the risk
      profile of Mexican-American adolescents, which increases their daily dietary intake that may
      contribute to metabolic syndrome via overweight. Acculturation also increased the likelihood
      of physical activity, but this association may be insufficient to override the other risk
      factors. These results suggest that acculturation should be considered when designing and
      implementing interventions or policies aimed at Mexican-American adolescents to reduce
      overweight, increase physical activity, and promote healthy dietary options. This may help to
      reduce the treatment costs associated with overweight and type-2 diabetes.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Background: Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) are those who: (1) have or
      are at increased risk for a chronic medical condition and (2) require more health care than
      children generally. Because the CSHCN designation is intended to improve access to care,
      including securing a medical home and public programs that address the health needs of CSHCN,
      an important policy issue is whether childhood overweight meets both criteria that define
      CSHCN. Methods: This is a cross-sectional analysis of two nationally representative data
      sources, the 2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the 2002
      Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Both surveys are used to examine the relationship
      between overweight and health status. NHANES is used to examine the relationship between
      overweight and three chronic conditions: dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, and hypertension. MEPS is
      used to examine the relationship between overweight, health care use and expenditures, and a
      medical home. Results: Overweight children, compared to healthy-weight children, have
      significantly increased risk for high total cholesterol, high or borderline LDL cholesterol,
      low HDL cholesterol, high triglycerides, high fasting glucose, high glycohemoglobin, and high
      systolic blood pressure. Overweight children report worse health status than healthy-weight
      children. Compared to healthy weight children, overweight children are less likely to have any
      health care expenditure; this difference does not remain after adjusting for socioeconomic
      status. Having a medical home tends to be associated with greater health care use and
      expenditures, though not consistently. Conclusions: These findings suggest that overweight
      children may meet the definition of CSHCN. They are clearly at increased risk for chronic
      health conditions that require more health care than that needed by healthy-weight children.
      Including overweight children under the umbrella of CSHCN is one potential strategy for
      improving access to care and enhancing health care resources available to overweight children.
      Such strategies to address overweight during childhood are critical to prevent chronic
      conditions, improve health status, and reduce health care expenditures, both during childhood
      and into adulthood.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Vaccination is the most effective control measure in the fight against infectious
      diseases, and represents an opportunity to intercede in the spread of dangerous organisms
      through prophylactic intervention. Viral vectors, including alphavirus vectors, have proven to
      be powerful vaccine delivery vehicles and a promising platform for vaccines against multiple
      pathogens. Specifically, as demonstrated here, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE)
      replicon particles (VRP) induced strong humoral, cell-mediated, and mucosal immune responses
      directed against heterologous antigens expressed from the viral genome, as well as against
      antigens simply mixed with VRP. These observations established a dual function of VRP as both
      vaccine expression vectors and vaccine adjuvants, demonstrating that VRP possess intrinsic
      immunostimulatory properties. When utilized as adjuvants, VRP systemic humoral adjuvant
      activity was as strong as the activity of CpG DNA. In addition, the mucosal responses induced
      by VRP adjuvants were superior to those induced by CpG, an effect that was dependent upon VRP
      RNA replication. The induction of mucosal immune responses is critical for vaccine-mediated
      protection following challenge with mucosal pathogens. Delivery of antigens directly to
      mucosal lymphoid tissues, as occurs following mucosal delivery, results in the strongest
      mucosal immune responses. While this has revealed the components of the natural mucosal
      inductive pathway, little is known regarding the lymphoid structures responsible for mucosal
      immune induction following nonmucosal delivery. Here we demonstrate that following nonmucosal
      VRP vaccination, several markers of mucosal lymphoid tissues were present in the draining
      lymph node (DLN). This included the presence of antigen-specific polymeric IgA antibodies,
      upregulated expression of the [alpha]4[beta]7 integrin on DLN lymphocytes, expression of the
      mucosal addressin, MAdCAM-1, and the production of IL-6 and other mucosal cytokines. The
      presence of these markers is consistent with a model in which the DLN is converted by VRP
      infection into the functional equivalent of a mucosal inductive site. Furthermore, while type
      I interferon (IFN) signaling was not required for VRP adjuvant activity, it was critical for
      the induction of mucosal IgA responses induced by VRP expression vectors. Together, these
      findings may significantly improve both our knowledge of viral immunology and the efficacy of
      viral-based vaccines.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Sindbis virus infection of mice has provided valuable insight into the viral and host
      factors that contribute to virus-induced neurologic disease. In an effort to further define
      the viral genetic elements that contribute to adult mouse neurovirulence, the virulent
      Sindbis-group virus strain AR86 was compared to the closely related (22 single amino acid
      coding differences and the presence or absence of an 18 amino acid sequence in nsP3), but
      avirulent Girdwood strain. Detailed mapping studies identified three major determinants in the
      nonstructural region at nsP1 538 (Ile to Thr; avirulent to virulent), an 18 amino acid
      deletion in nsP3 (positions 386-403), and nsP3 537 (Opal to Cys; avirulent to virulent), as
      well as a single determinant in the structural genes at E2 243 (Leu to Ser; avirulent to
      virulent) that were essential for AR86 adult mouse neurovirulence. Of these four virulence
      determinants, we found that the virulence determinant at nsP1 538 plays a particularly
      important role. This determinant has been shown to regulate viral nonstructural processing,
      viral RNA synthesis, and play a major role in regulating adult mouse neurovirulence. Analysis
      of the effect of the nsP1 538 determinant on modulating the host antiviral response
      demonstrated that an attenuating mutation at nsP1 538 resulted in enhanced type I interferon
      induction. While most alphaviruses have been shown to inhibit type I interferon induction
      through virus-induced host cell shutoff, we demonstrated that the Sindbis-group virus strain
      AR86 inhibits type I interferon induction through an additional mechanism by inhibiting the
      activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), a key mediator of type I interferon
      induction. In an effort to extend these findings, we examined virus interactions with the type
      I interferon induction signaling pathway. We found that although AR86 genomic RNA is
      efficiently recognized by retinoic-acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), a host cytoplasmic sensor of
      viral dsRNA, AR86 virus actively antagonized IRF-3 activation induced from an exogenous source
      of dsRNA. Furthermore, the viral nonstructural proteins (nsPs), when expressed independently
      of virus infection, inhibited RIG-I and melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5 (Mda5), a
      related host cytoplasmic sensor of viral dsRNA, signaling. Strikingly, co-expression of the
      viral nsPs proteins led to the loss of RIG-I, Mda5, and IRF-3 expression in a manner that was
      dependent on the nsP2 protease. These results demonstrate that the viral nonstructural
      proteins specifically antagonize the type I interferon induction signaling pathway and suggest
      that the virus may directly target components of the type I interferon induction signaling
      pathway. The results from these studies have provided significant insight into the viral and
      host factors that mediate virus-induced disease and have advanced our understanding of the
      mechanisms underlying alphavirus pathogenesis.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Inositol phospholipids are a unique collection of signaling molecules involved in an
      extensive variety of signaling events including actin remodeling, membrane trafficking, and
      calcium mobilization. Phosphoinositides regulate signaling responses by binding specific
      effector proteins, or through the generation of second messenger molecules. The most well
      characterized phosphoinositide signaling pathway is the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol
      (4,5)-bisphosphate by the phospholipase C (PLC) family of enzymes. PLCs cleaves the inositol
      headgroup from the glycerol backbone of PtdIns(4,5)P2, generating the second messenger
      molecules inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. An extensive array of
      extracellular signaling molecules elicit their physiological effects through receptor-mediated
      stimulation of PLC isozymes. All PLC enzymes contain a conserved catalytic region; however,
      elaboration of the catalytic core with various protein binding and/or regulatory domains gives
      rise to multiple modes of regulation and different PLC subfamilies. Recent work has implicated
      Ras superfamily GTPases in the regulation of several PLC isoforms adding a new level of
      complexity to phosphoinositide metabolism. Phospholipase C-epsilon (PLC-[epsilon]) is an
      elaborate PLC isoform that is regulated by several signaling pathways, including downstream of
      both heterotrimeric and Ras superfamily GTPases. The work described herein examines the
      regulation of PLC-[epsilon] enzyme activity through direct interactions with Ras superfamily
      GTPases. We describe the purification and functional characterization of a catalytically
      active fragment of PLC-[epsilon] with the goal of providing incontrovertible evidence
      regarding direct Rho and Ras family regulation of enzyme activity. Reconstitution of purified
      proteins in model phospholipid vesicles demonstrates RhoA and K-Ras individually are
      sufficient to increase the activity of PLC-[epsilon] in both a concentration- and
      GTP[gamma]S-dependent manner. Moreover, RhoA and K-Ras required mutually exclusive sites of
      interaction to confer increased PLC-[epsilon] activity. Finally, when maximally activated by
      RhoA or K-Ras, PLC-[epsilon] activity is increased further by the addition of the
      complementary GTPase, and the enzyme displayed increased sensitivity to KRas in the presence
      of a maximally activating concentration of RhoA. These results identify PLC-[epsilon] as a
      novel enzyme that is regulated by Rho and Ras family GTPases through distinct domains, leading
      to individual and dual regulation of enzyme activity.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Mounting evidence shows that primary somatosensory cortex, particularly SI, is
      actively engaged in dynamic processing of sensory information evoked by skin stimulation. SI
      plays both active and modulating roles in amplitude and frequency discrimination as well as in
      the processing of noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli. SI is one cortical region in which
      interactions between cortical activity evoked by low frequency flutter and high frequency
      vibration are spatially and temporally integrated. In this dissertation, functional magnetic
      resonance imaging was used to image cortical responses to microstimulation of individual,
      functionally identified skin mechanoreceptive afferents which are, under natural stimulus
      conditions, effectively activated by very selective ranges of stimulation frequency.
      Microstimulation of mechanoreceptive and nociceptive afferents evoked significant activation
      in multiple cortical areas. Peak magnitudes of hemodynamic responses in SI and SII did not
      differ significantly when rapidly adapting afferent microstimulation frequency was increased
      from 30 to 200Hz. Thus, rapidly adapting afferent activation alone cannot account for the
      suppression of SI cortical activity that is observed when high frequency vibrotactile stimuli
      are applied to the skin; this leads to the hypothesis that PC microstimulation causes
      suppression of SI cortical activity regardless of stimulus frequency. Images of activity
      evoked by microstimulation of PC afferents support this hypothesis. Additionally,
      microstimulation of nociceptive afferents evoked significant activation in multiple cortical
      areas consistent with animal studies utilizing invasive data collection methods. Future
      studies of hemodynamic responses to vibrotactile stimulation and noxious stimulation will
      clarify human cortical mechanisms responsible for the spatial-temporal integration evoked by
      different modalities of skin stimulation. The construction and utilization of an
      MRI-compatible vibrotactile stimulator that can be used in such future studies is also
      described in this manuscript.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Traditional views of primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and its role in the processing
      of tactile information have limited its function as a dynamic component in the somatosensory
      pathway. Here I present evidence that the response in SI to stimuli at a given skin site is
      systematically modified with changes in the stimulus parameters and displays considerable
      dynamics. Optical intrinsic signal (OIS) imaging was used to study the responses (in vivo)
      evoked by 25 Hz (flutter) vertical skin displacement stimuli to the forelimb of squirrel
      monkey and cat. Responses to electrical stimulation were also measured in rat sensorimotor
      cortical slices using OIS imaging and local field potential (LFP) recordings. Results indicate
      that, contrary to traditional views, the intensive but not spatial attributes of the SI
      response are modified by increases in stimulus amplitude. Increasing the duration of flutter
      stimulation evokes increases in response magnitude in cortical regions near to the maximally
      responding center and simultaneous decreases in surrounding cortical regions; the net effect
      of this is the spatial sharpening of the SI response during prolonged stimulation. The
      distribution of decreased absorbance in surrounding cortex was non-uniform, indicating the
      possibility of stronger intracortical inhibition along the proximodistal axis of the body
      representation. Cortical slices in the sagital and coronal planes of the rat somatosensory
      cortex demonstrated a similar anisotropy in the distribution and impact of GABAergic
      inhibition on the horizontal spread of activity, and lend support to the idea that the
      non-uniformity observed in vivo may contain functional relevance. Bilateral stimulation of
      both forelimbs demonstrated that, although input to SI has been traditionally regarded as
      exclusively contralateral, not only can the response to an ipsilateral stimulus be measured in
      SI, but when stimulation is applied bilaterally the spatiotemporal characteristics of the
      evoked response cannot be accounted for by the responses of either stimulus alone or by the
      linear summation of the pair. All of these results taken together present a strong case for
      the necessity of strong dynamics in SI and the role of SI as an important site of cortical
      information processing in the somatosensory pathway.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The cochlear nucleus is the termination point for all axons of the auditory nerve. In
      addition to input from the auditory nerve, the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) receives input
      from other sensory systems. The principal neurons of the DCN, the pyramidal cells, process
      information from both the auditory and non-auditory inputs and relay this information to the
      inferior colliculus. While it is known that pyramidal cells can use spike timing to encode
      some auditory information such as frequency modulation, these neurons are usually described in
      terms of average rate. This study examines the spike timing characteristics of DCN pyramidal
      cells. We first investigated the spike timing characteristics of pyramidal cells by presenting
      the cells with Gaussian distributed white noise currents. In response to such stimuli,
      pyramidal cells fired trains of action potentials with precisely timed spikes. In addition,
      when an inhibitory event, such as an IPSP was added at the midpoint of the stimulus, the spike
      times became more precise after the IPSP than they were without the inhibitory event.
      Intrinsic conductances can shape the output of neurons. One important conductance is a
      transient outward current known as an A-current. A-currents arise from potassium channels such
      as Kv1.4, Kv3.4 and the entire Kv4 family. It has been hypothesized that an A-current leads to
      the build-up response pattern in pyramidal cells, which is characterized by a long latency to
      the first spike. Using heteropodatoxin-2, a specific blocker of Kv4 channels, we determined
      that Kv4 channels are responsible for the long delay to the first spike after a
      hyperpolarizing pre-pulse. To confirm this result, we also subtracted a model of the Acurrent
      using dynamic clamp and observed the same effect. Finally, the identity of this potassium
      current was determined using in situ hybridization and immunofluoresence. Pyramidal cells were
      labeled by injecting a retrograde dye into the inferior colliculus. Labeled pyramidal cells
      expressed Kv4.3 but not Kv4.2 potassium channels. From these results we concluded that Kv4.3
      is essential for the characteristic response patterns observed in DCN pyramidal cells.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Traditional tactile sensory testing has relied heavily on delivery of single-site
      stimuli to the skin and querying test subjects on various qualities of those stimuli. While
      these methods are effective in making measures that characterize the peripheral nervous
      system, they lack in quantitatively assessing centrally mediated disorders of the nervous
      system. Additionally, the models from which the developments of such peripherally-based
      protocols originate are based more on historical precedence of prior techniques than on a
      characterization of the central nervous system. This thesis describes the development of not
      only novel methods for delivering multi-site tactile stimuli, but a novel approach for sensory
      testing based on models derived from measures of neural population response yielded from
      in-vivo and in-vitro animal experimentation. During the course of this study, two separate
      stimulators were designed and fabricated. The first, referred to as the "Two-Point
      Stimulator" (TPS), was a prototype developed to improve upon previously existing
      methods for delivering vibrotaction during psychophysical and physiological experimentation.
      To test the device, tracking protocols were used to assess the ability of human subjects to
      discriminate and localize between two near-adjacent skin sites under stimulus conditions of
      varying amplitude, frequency, location, and duration. Data collected were consistent with
      previously published reports, suggesting that one possible use of the device would be to
      provide a means for improved measures of spatio-tactile acuity. These studies were repeated on
      subjects with autism resulting in significant differences in performance from that of the
      normal population. Correlating data obtained from these psychophysical experiments with
      cortical measures, acquired primarily with optical imaging and neural recording techniques in
      animal experimentation, has allowed us to develop a better understanding of the cortical
      dynamics involved in somatosensory processing. A second stimulator fabricated during this
      period, the CM-1 (Cortical Metrics - Model #1), improves considerably upon the TPS, most
      notably in portability, cost, and functional capability. Current ongoing experimentation using
      this novel device allows an improved means for measuring tactile sensibility and assessing
      differences in cortical information-processing strategies between normal healthy control
      populations and populations with various neurological disorders, in both research and clinical
      settings.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Activity provides a protective effect against cognitive and physical decline in older
      adults. Recent literature suggests that for older adults, variety and frequency of activity
      may be more important to this protective effect than intensity level. Although the ideal
      amount, type, and intensity of activity for preventing decline has not been determined,
      current tools for measuring activity are inadequate. A review of current activity measures
      used for older adults revealed that there is no reliable and valid tool to quantify variety or
      frequency of participation in different types of activities. Using a cross sectional design, I
      developed, tested and validated the Variety of Activity Questionnaire (VAQ) to measure
      frequency and variety in social, cognitive, physical, and exercise activity domains, and
      examined associations among frequency and variety with physical and cognitive function.
      Questionnaires were collected from 196 community dwelling older adults (range: 70 - 99 years,
      mean: 78.7 years) in North Carolina. Exploratory factor analysis evaluated the underlying
      structure of the VAQ. An ICC was used to assess test-retest reliability for the outcomes of
      total activity (TA) and variety of activity (VA) on a subset of 30 participants and construct
      validity on a different subset of 53 participants. Physical and cognitive performance measures
      were assessed on 95 participants. Regression analyses identified demographic and performance
      measures significantly associated with TA and VA. The VAQ demonstrated acceptable test-retest
      reliability [ICC 2,1 = .69 (TA), .72 (VA)] and validity [ICC 2,1 = .57(TA), .71(VA)]. The VAQ
      failed to factor; therefore, the structure and components of the VAQ were not modified. A
      mobility measure and marital status were significant predictors of VA, and a dynamic balance
      measure was a significant predictor of TA. Measures of attention and processing speed were
      significantly related to both VA and TA, but had stronger associations with VA. Variety of
      activity appears to have stronger associations with physical and cognitive performance than
      TA, suggesting that variety of activity may be important for function. The VAQ has potential
      as a tool for researchers and clinicians and warrants continued study. Future intervention
      studies will clarify the relationship between variety of activity and function.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Thrombin, the main effector protease of the coagulation cascade elicits its cellular
      effects via activation of a family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) called
      proteaseactivated receptors (PARs). PAR1, the prototype of this family, is expressed in cells
      in and around blood vessels and mediates thrombin elicited cellular responses that are
      essential for hemostasis and thrombosis, embryonic development, and cancer progression.
      Thrombin binds to and cleaves the amino-terminal exodomain of PAR1, thus exposing a newly
      formed amino-terminus that binds intramolecularly to the body of the receptor and causes
      transmembrane signaling. Due to the irreversible, proteolytic mechanism of PAR1 activation,
      processes that contribute to signal termination, including desensitization, internalization
      and downregulation, are critically important for thrombin-elicited cellular responses. PAR1
      displays two modes of receptor trafficking. Constitutive PAR1 internalization is mediated by
      the adaptor protein complex-2 (AP2), but is independent of arrestins, and is important for
      resensitization of thrombin signaling. Activated PAR1 internalizes by a clathrin- and
      dynamin-dependent pathway that is independent of arrestins and AP2 and is then sorted directly
      to lysosomes for degradation, a process that is important for signal termination. Studies of
      mammalian and yeast GPCRs have demonstrated a role for ubiquitination in trafficking of GPCRs.
      A major focus of this dissertation was to understand the role of ubiquitination in PAR1
      trafficking. We found that PAR1 is basally ubiquitinated and undergoes agonist-induced
      deubiquitination. Ubiquitination of PAR1 negatively regulates constitutive internalization and
      specifies a distinct clathrin adaptor requirement for activated receptor internalization. PAR1
      ubiquitination appears to inhibit binding of AP2 to PAR1 and therefore helps to retain PAR1 at
      the cell surface. The clathrin adaptor protein epsin binds to activated and ubiquitinated PAR1
      to mediate receptor internalization. A deubiquitinated form of the receptor is sorted to
      lysosomes by a ubiquitin-independent mechanism that requires sorting nexin-1. These studies
      reveal a novel function for ubiquitination in regulation of GPCR trafficking.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Peroxisome proliferators are a structurally diverse group of chemicals that are
      non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens in rodents. For decades there has been controversy surrounding
      these compounds because of the uncertainty of human risk, high potential for exposure and
      insufficient understanding of their mechanism of action in rodents. Two key molecular pathways
      are thought to be important in the mode of action: activation of the nuclear receptor
      PPAR[alpha] in liver parenchymal cells, and activation of Kupffer cells, which do not express
      PPAR[alpha]. In hepatocytes, PPAR[alpha] mediates peroxisome induction, increased fatty acid
      metabolism and alterations in gene expression. Furthermore, activation of the PPAR[alpha] is
      required for peroxisome proliferator-induced carcinogenesis. In Kupffer cells, acute
      administration of peroxisome proliferators stimulates oxidant production and mitogenic
      cytokine release, as well as activation of NF[kappa]B, a transcription factor implicated in
      cell proliferation and apoptosis. The role that Kupffer cells play in chronic effects of
      peroxisome proliferators is not yet known. We hypothesized that peroxisome proliferators
      activate Kupffer cells to produce oxidants that may be involved in oxidative cellular damage,
      and that mediate cytokine production. The cytokines stimulate proliferative and anti-apoptotic
      effects of these chemical agents. To test this hypothesis, we first evaluated whether
      peroxisome proliferators cause a sustained increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in rodent
      liver. In vivo measurements of ROS in PPAR[alpha] -null or NADPH oxidase-deficient
      (p47phox-null) mice following sub-acute treatment with di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) or
      4-chloro-6-(2,3- xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio acetic acid (WY-14,643), both model peroxisome
      proliferators revealed a persistent elevation in oxidant production with parenchymal cells,
      not Kupffer cells as the primary molecular source. Next, the role of Kupffer cell oxidants and
      PPAR[alpha] in mediating proliferative, apoptotic and oxidative stress responses was assessed.
      Findings from a five month WY-14,643 feeding study suggest that NADPH oxidase is not required
      for increased hepatocellularl proliferation or DNA damage, but may be important to
      antiapoptotic effects. Finally, gene expression profiling revealed a temporal shift from
      Kupffer cell to PPAR[alpha]-dependence of peroxisome proliferator-induced changes.
      Collectively, our findings demonstrate that Kupffer cell-mediated events play an important
      role in early responses, but are short-lived and likely not required for chronic effects of
      peroxisome proliferators, including hepatocarcinogenesis.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Asian American women have the lowest mammography and Pap test rates among all other
      racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. (American Cancer Society, 2006a). The elimination of
      these health disparities among Asian American women is currently a national priority and
      strategies to reduce the breast and cervical cancer burden are urgently needed. The purpose of
      this evaluation study was to assess current strategies and to provide recommendations for
      improving recruitment, retention and delivery of services to Asian American women in the
      National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP), a free screening
      program for eligible low-income women. A cultural competency conceptual framework formed the
      basis of this investigation. The study was conducted in three phases: 1) Written surveys
      completed by 41 NBCCEDP state program directors; 2) Telephone interviews conducted with 28 key
      NBCCEDP program administrators and service providers; and 3) Site visits in three states with
      the highest Asian American population, and interviews with 62 Asian American women (40 NBCCEDP
      participants and 22 non-NBCCEDP participants who were eligible for the program). A utilization
      focused evaluation approach with both quantitative and qualitative methods were employed to
      analyze the data. Results revealed that 11 cultural competency strategies are recommended for
      use by program directors, outreach coordinators, service providers and Asian American women
      (both NBCCEDP participants and non-participants) when recruiting, retaining, and providing
      services to Asian American women in the NBCCEDP: (1) conduct demographic profile and
      assessment of needs, strengths and assets of the client population; (2) develop linguistic
      competence; (3) use lay health advisors; (4) provide culturally and linguistically appropriate
      health education materials and strategies; (5) develop partnerships with communities and
      community organizations; (6) include family and community members; (7) facilitate learning
      between providers and community; (8) coordinate with practitioners of traditional medicine;
      (9) develop policies to recruit and retain culturally diverse staff; (10) incorporate
      administrative and organizational strategies and; (11) provide patient navigation services.
      Implications for practice directed to the NBCCEDP program administrators, as well as
      implications for future research on recruitment, retention and service delivery of Asian
      American women in this national program will be discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Most children who die do so in the hospital, most often in the PICU. Little is known
      about how parents view or remember this experience. In this study parents who had a child die
      in one PICU during 2004 and 2005 (total of 84 children, one set of twins) were asked to share
      their memories of having a child die in the PICU and to rate the quality of various aspects of
      their experience. Nineteen parents, one foster parent, and three grandparents of 14 children
      participated. Parents recalled memories of the experience during an audio-recorded interview.
      The interviews were loosely structured to have parents address what they remembered about
      their experiences of maintaining their family roles, establishing relationships with health
      care providers, sharing and communicating information, pain and symptom control for their
      child, and the systems of support offered by the health care team. Parents were also asked for
      their recommendations to improve this experience with the goal of answering the question of
      what is essential to enabling a good death in the PICU. Parents' evaluation of the quality of
      their child's dying and death in the PICU was determined using a modified version of the
      Quality of Dying and Death Questionnaire. The aim was to obtain information directly from
      parents about certain modifiable aspects of end-of-life care for children in the PICU. Results
      suggest that parents of dying children want more direct communication and information about
      their child's condition; that they want to remain both present and involved in caring for
      their child until and after they die; and that they want and need some follow-up contact after
      their child has died.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Cancer is the leading cause of death for those under 85 years of age in the United
      States. All-cause cancer rates are higher for African Americans than other racial or ethnic
      groups; however, the reasons for this disproportionately high cancer burden are not well
      understood. Diets high in fruits and vegetables have been associated with lower risk of many
      cancers. One mechanism by which diet may reduce cancer risk is through consumption of
      antioxidant nutrients, which decrease the adverse effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on
      normal physiological functions. High ROS levels can lead to oxidative stress, in which the
      imbalance of radical-generating agent concentrations exceeds the body's defense mechanisms.
      Under conditions of elevated oxidative stress (e.g., low antioxidant intakes) defenses may be
      overwhelmed and excess oxidative stress can lead to oxidative damage of DNA causing
      significant base damage, strand breaks, and ultimately carcinogenesis. Using data from a
      generally healthy sample of African American and White adult participants in the DIet,
      Supplements, and Health (DISH) study (n=164, 51% African American), we examined potential
      racial differences in antioxidant (vitamin C, vitamin E, and carotenoids) intakes/blood
      concentrations and oxidative DNA damage; associations between plasma antioxidant
      concentrations and oxidative DNA damage; and demographic, behavioral, and psychosocial
      correlates of individual antioxidant concentrations and oxidative DNA damage. In addition, we
      determined psychosocial correlates of fruit and vegetable (antioxidant rich foods) intakes in
      African Americans in a cross-sectional study of African Americans ages 18 to 70 (n=658). This
      research fills important gaps in knowledge by contributing information about potential racial
      differences in 1) antioxidant intakes and blood concentrations, 2) oxidative stress levels, 3)
      associations between antioxidant concentrations and oxidative stress, 4) demographic,
      behavioral, and psychosocial factors that influence blood concentrations of antioxidants and
      oxidative DNA damage levels and also those of antioxidant-rich foods. The identification of
      modifiable factors (e.g., diet), mechanisms of carcinogenesis (e.g., oxidative DNA damage),
      and/or mediating factors that contribute to these factors (e.g., psychosocial factors) are
      critical for the design and implementation of cancer prevention and control programs to reduce
      the disparate cancer burden among African Americans.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Two analyses were performed using data from an 18-month study of a condom promotion
      intervention among 1000 female sex workers (FSW) in two cities in Madagascar. The first
      analysis explored whether participating in such a study and being exposed to such an
      intervention over time would change the strength of the association between self-reported
      condom use and incident sexually transmitted infections (STI). The analysis found no evidence
      of a change in the association over time. In addition, there was no indication of a
      dose-response relationship between the number of reported unprotected sex acts and incidence
      of STI. The second analysis tested the risk of STI associated with self-reported condom use by
      partner type. Over the 18 months of the study, participants reported greatly increased rates
      of condom use with clients, but continued low condom use with personal partners. Participants
      who reported less than 100% condom use with personal partners, but 100% condom use with
      clients had no increased odds of STI as compared to those who reported 100% condom use with
      both partner types (odds ratio (OR) 0.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.5, 1.6). Conversely,
      participants who reported inconsistent condom use with clients, but consistent condom use with
      their personal partners had an 8.3 times higher odds of STI (95% CI 0.5, 138.0) as compared to
      consistent condom users with both partner types. We conclude that asking study participants to
      report the actual number of sex acts and the number of those sex acts that were protected by
      condoms may result in falsely precise estimates of their exposure to risky sex acts. The
      results indicating that unprotected sex with personal partners does not contribute to risk of
      STI are contrary to indications from other recent studies in West Africa about the infection
      status of personal partners of FSW. The relationship should be further explored before
      programs change the message that FSW should use condoms with all partners.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine the speech, language, and phonological
      awareness skills of children with cleft palate ranging in age from 4 to 6 years old.
      Twenty-three children with clefts were compared to a sample of 23 matched peers without clefts
      on standardized measures of phonological awareness, speech production, and language skill
      development. Paired samples t-tests did not yield statistically significant between group
      differences on measures of phonological awareness. Similarly, comparison of children with
      clefts to normative data available with phonological awareness testing measures also did not
      yield statistically significant differences. Further examination of the phonological awareness
      skills of children with clefts was conducted with regard to speech production, language
      skills, and hearing status. Correlational analyses revealed a positive relationship between
      speech production and alliteration awareness. Two measures of receptive language were found to
      be positively correlated to alliteration awareness and rhyme awareness. Finally, there was a
      positive relationship between alliteration awareness and the number of recent ear infections a
      child had experienced. The results of this study suggest children with clefts demonstrate
      phonological awareness skills that are similar to their peers. Given the relationship
      identified between phonological awareness skills and receptive language skills, practitioners
      working with children with clefts should not only continue to monitor the speech production
      skills of children with clefts, but also assess language development and phonological
      awareness in order to ensure these children have the skills to become strong readers.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Dbl-related oncoproteins are guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) specific for
      Rho-family GTPases and typically possess tandem Dbl (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains
      that act in concert to catalyze exchange. The exchange activities of many Dbl-proteins are
      regulated by phosphorylation or constitutively activated by truncations preceding their DH
      domains. However, exact mechanisms of regulation remain poorly understood. Here we show that a
      sub-group of Dbl-family proteins, including Tim, Ngef, and Wgef, are auto-inhibited by a
      highly conserved helix immediately N-terminal to the DH domain that directly occludes the
      catalytic interface of the DH domain to prevent GTPase activation. Similar to the distantly
      related Vav isozymes, auto-inhibition is relieved by truncation, mutation, or phosphorylation
      of the auto-inhibitory helix. Furthermore, substitutions within a highly conserved surface of
      the DH domain designed to disrupt interactions with the auto-inhibitory helix also fully
      activates the exchange process. Therefore, the regulated auto-inhibition of DH domains by
      direct steric exclusion using short N-terminal segments likely represents a general mode of
      regulation within the large family of Dbl-family proteins. The C-terminal SH3 domain binding
      to a polyproline region N-terminal to the DH domain of this subgroup of Dbl-family proteins
      provides a unique mechanism of regulated auto-inhibition of exchange activity that is
      functionally linked to the interactions between the auto-inhibitory helix and the DH domain.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This research focused on the effect of vaginal lactobacilli and estrogen on
      trichomoniasis. Vaginal lactobacilli were evaluated by vaginal Gram stain, using criteria
      described by Nugent [1]. Women with [greater than or equal to]30 large Lactobacillus spp.
      morphotypes per oil immersion field were classified as having higher vaginal lactobacilli
      levels. Women with [less than or equal to]30 large Lactobacillus spp. morphotypes per oil
      immersion field were classified as having lower levels. After adjusting for age,
      race/ethnicity, education, concurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV), concurrent gonorrhea and/or
      syphilis, number of sex partners in the past 2 months, number of times the woman has sex in an
      average week, and oral contraceptive (OC) use, low levels of vaginal lactobacilli were
      positively associated with Trichomonas vaginalis (Tv) among women with greater than a high
      school education (odds ratio [OR]=4.6; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 2.2-9.7). Trichomonas
      vaginalis was not associated with low levels of lactobacilli among women with less than or
      equal to a high school education in multivariable analysis (OR=1.5; 95% CI, 0.7-3.5). The
      association between OC use and Tv was also estimated. Women who reported using OC with their
      most recent and/or frequent sexual partners were categorized as using OC. Women who did not
      report using OC with their most recent and/or frequent sexual partner were classified as not
      using OC. After adjusting for race/ethnicity, highest educational level attained, condom use,
      concurrent BV, level of vaginal lactobacilli, number of sex partners in the past year and
      number of times the woman has sex in an average week, OC was moderately protective against Tv
      (OR= 0.6, 95% CI 0.3-1.0). These data suggest that trichomoniasis may be influenced by level
      of vaginal lactobacilli and OC use.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The process of stroke alters the vascular physiology of the brain. In this
      dissertation, we have focused on the assessment of cerebrovascular alterations under two
      ischemic conditions: chronic hypertension with increased cerebral blood perfusion pressure
      (CPP) and transient focal cerebral ischemia with decreased CPP via the stroke-prone
      spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRsp) model and the suture model, respectively. Based on these
      two models, the temporal evolutions of water content, permeability of BBB and cerebral blood
      volume (CBV), were monitored using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In SHRsp rats, there was
      no significant water content increase before BBB breakdown, indicating the vasogenic nature of
      the edema. A weak linear relationship was found between the water content and the permeability
      to Gd-DTPA during edema development after BBB breakdown, suggesting that the movement of water
      into brain tissue could have been facilitated by the increase in cerebrovascular permeability
      to such small molecules as Gd-DTPA. In addition, our results showed that, in SHRsp rats, the
      occurrence of BBB breakdown was no later than the presence of hemorrhage and the decrease of
      CBV under the symptoms of weight loss and enlarged ventricles. In a suture model of 90 min
      occlusion, while BBB permeability followed a biphasic pattern, the water content showed an
      increasing trend. BBB leakage did not play an important role in water content increase out to
      at least 6hr after reperfusion. After that, BBB breakdown worsened the edema formation. When
      permeability was recovered at 24 hr after reperfusion, water content reached its maximal value
      of the study period. In conclusion, though both chronic hypertension with increased CPP or
      acute ischemia with decreased CPP can result in BBB breakdown and edema development, the
      stroke development patterns are different under these two conditions. Our results shed some
      light on the roles of BBB breakdown in edema formation, may help to evaluate and monitor the
      effectiveness of therapeutic intervention, and may aid the development of new therapies
      targeted at maintainance of the BBB.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The Early Iron Age (c. 1200-700 B.C.) on Crete is a period of transition, comprising
      the years after the final collapse of the palatial system in Late Minoan IIIB up to the
      development of the polis, or city-state, by or during the Archaic period. Over the course of
      this period, significant changes occurred in settlement patterns, settlement forms, ritual
      contexts, and most strikingly, in burial practices. Early Iron Age burial practices varied
      extensively throughout the island, not only from region to region, but also often at a single
      site; for example, at least 12 distinct tomb types existed on Crete during this time, and both
      inhumation and cremation were used, as well as single and multiple burial. As part of this
      study, over 1200 tombs found in the vicinity of 122 modern villages or towns have been
      catalogued. An examination of the burial methods, architecture, assemblages, dates, and
      spatial contexts of these tombs and cemeteries provides significant new evidence regarding the
      extent of cultural diversity present on the island during this period. The funerary evidence
      clearly indicates that Crete was characterized by extensive regionalism during the Early Iron
      Age; seven distinct mortuary regions, as well as four transitional or ‘border’ zones, are
      identified from the funerary material. In addition, a regional examination of the burial
      practices provides new evidence regarding the changes in political organization and social
      structure which occurred on the island over the course of the period.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation advances our understanding of the assimilation processes of
      post-1965 immigrants and their descendants. In particular, I select issues that have not been
      intensively examined before, addressing three major life events during adulthood, including
      college education, union formation, and labor market outcomes, to investigate adaptation
      processes of immigrants and their offspring. Chapter 2 examines the possible educational
      pathways the new second immigrant generation may take during transition to adulthood. To
      assess their degree of assimilation, I make two levels of comparison. At the first level, I
      examine horizontal intergenerational mobility by comparing the educational status of the new
      second generation with their parents. I find that the new second-generation youth, as a whole,
      are doing better than their parents in high school graduation. However, the pace and degree of
      intergenerational mobility varies by ethnic backgrounds regarding college education. At the
      second level, I assess vertical inter-class mobility by comparing the educational status of
      the new second generation with the third- and higher-generation non-Hispanic white peers
      (mainstream proxy). I find that there is stratification of college education for interclass
      mobility. While Mexican Americans are much less likely to attend college than their third- and
      higher-generation white counterparts, Cuban Americans and Asian Americans are more likely to
      go on with college education than their third- and plus-generation non-Hispanic white
      generation. Disadvantaged groups, like Mexican Americans and those of other Central-South
      American and Caribbean origins, lag behind in such social factors as parental human capital,
      family structure, and family size, which contribute to reduce their likelihood of college
      education and probably their eventual lower status in American stratification system. Chapter
      3 examines union formation processes among young adults of different immigrant generations
      during transition to adulthood. As living together without marrying becomes a common
      phenomenon among young adults in American society, one may ask whether immigrant descendants
      who are raised in ethnic Asian or Hispanic families will take the union formation pattern of
      cohabitation as their native peers do. This chapter provides strong and robust evidence
      regarding that first generation youth are less likely to embrace the alternative union
      formation path of cohabitation in the presence of cultural, structural, and contextual
      controls, as compared to the third and highergeneration non-Hispanic white peers. In addition,
      the first generation is more likely to take the traditional route of marriage during early
      adulthood. Chapter 4 shifts the research attention to examine the economic adaptation
      processes of contemporary Asian and Hispanic immigrants in comparison to their native peers in
      the context of a segmented labor market. I first re-define the U.S. labor market into four
      segments: non-enclave primary segment, non-enclave secondary segment, enclave-primary segment,
      and enclave-secondary segment. I then focus on the impact of various nativity and immigrant
      statuses on labor market outcomes, including labor segment membership, hourly wages, and
      non-monetary job benefits, among immigrants. I find that native-born and naturalized
      citizenship are more advantageous statuses than non-permanent residency and permanent
      residency to incorporate immigrants and their descendants into the mainstream labor market and
      facilitate their attainment of higher wages and more job benefits. Non-naturalized immigrants
      are much more likely to be concentrated in ethnic enclaves and in lower rungs of the open
      market, and subject to lower pay and fewer benefits due to their inferior immigrant statuses.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) problem area emerged as an international
      concern for institutions, goverments and communities of experts in the mid 1990s. In the
      following pages, I historicize both the conditons of possibility and actualization of the IDPs
      by linking this formation to a set events necessary for its appearance both as an object of
      knowledge and intervention during the years of 1992-1998. I analyze how this ensemble of
      discourses was introduced in Colombia in 1995, how they have operated through institutional
      interventions, and what have been their side-effects. In my conclusions, I discuss how these
      practices are also part of the present neoliberal govermentality by which caring for and
      protecting specific communities are both understood under specific rationalities. I end by
      suggesting that both social movements and grassroots organizations are precisely resisting
      these rationalities through the defense of local and collective ethical projects.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Research suggests that, in addition to training, the utilization of a proper warm-up
      protocol may improve results of maximal performance testing. However, the impact of different
      protocols has been inconclusive. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of a dynamic
      warm-up (DWU) protocol compared to a static stretching warm-up (SSWU) protocol on speed and
      agility performance. Fifteen male collegiate club sports athletes participated in this study.
      Results suggested a significantly faster 40-Yard Dash following the DWU protocol compared to
      the SSWU (p&lt;0.005). Meanwhile, results suggested no significant difference in time to
      completion for the Pro Agility Shuttle between the two protocols (p&gt;0.005). Elevated
      muscle and core temperatures, increased neuromuscular activation, and rehearsal of movement
      are among the factors that may have led to the improved 40-Yard Dash performance.
      Additionally, confounding factors (footwear, running surface, and knowledge of testing
      techniques) could have played a role in the non-significant Pro Agility Shuttles times.</mods:abstract>

      works I address do not appear as photographs alongside the text, but rather as descriptions in
      the text. I address two diasporic writers from Hispaniola whose works include textual
      descriptions of photographs: Junot Díaz, born in the Dominican Republic who currently resides
      in New York and Edwidge Danticat, born in Haiti who currently resides in Miami.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Objective: Investigate the effect of helmet fit on cervical spine motion during a log
      roll in ice hockey. Design: Paired samples t-tests and within subjects ANOVA’s conducted for
      movement in three planes to determine if a significant difference in cervical spine motion
      existed under three helmet conditions (1- properly fitted, 2-competition, 3-removed). Setting:
      Sports Medicine Research Laboratory. Participants: 16 ice hockey players. Measurements: Head
      and helmet motion relative to the thorax in three planes using the Flock of Birds, reported in
      deg/sec. Results: No significant difference in helmet to thorax motion and significantly less
      head to thorax motion for sagittal and transverse planes when condition 3 is compared to 1 and
      2. In the frontal plane, condition 2 yielded significantly less motion than 1. Conclusion:
      More motion occurred in the sagittal and transverse planes during the log roll of an ice
      hockey player when the helmet remained in place.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Following the conquest of North India, the Awadhi capital of Lucknow became the site
      of significant cultural interaction between Europeans and Indians, with men moving in and
      among the city's various communities. Johann Zoffany's Colonel Antoine Polier, Claud Martin
      and John Wombwell with the Artist (1786-7) presents several such men of European birth in the
      format of the conversation piece. This paper will treat Zoffany's painting as an assertion of
      British control that was in many ways at odds with the city’s flexible cultural boundaries. In
      considering its connections to British pictorial traditions and the concerns of the East India
      Company at the end of the eighteenth century, I aim to uncover the ways in which Zoffany's
      painting offers the viewer a lens through which to consider the various processes of
      construction—individual, imperial and artistic—taking place during the early period of British
      India.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This experiment determined the acute and cumulative responses of IL-6 and TNF-7 to
      three consecutive days of intensive training (Session I, II and III). Results showed that
      exercise caused a similar increase in IL-6 from pre- to post-exercise for all sessions, but no
      changes in resting, baseline values. Results also showed an increase in TNF-7 after Sessions
      II and III, but not Session I. The percent change in TNF-7 was greatest for Session II, and
      resting TNF-7 was significantly elevated by the end of the study. In conclusion, three days of
      intensive training separated by ~24 hours do not result in a significant widening of the “Open
      Window” period following exercise, as the environment created by exercise in predominantly
      anti-inflammatory, as evidenced by increased IL-6. This means that athletes who train
      intensively for three consecutive days do not appear to be at a greater risk of becoming ill.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The Division III Football Championship Committee uses a geographic proximity rule when
      seeding the playoff bracket. Cost prevention and missed class time have been cited as reasons
      for the rule’s implementation. Two sets of paired-samples t-tests compared the travel costs
      and travel distances of the first round 2002–2006 playoff competitions to re-seeded brackets
      not implementing the rule. Tests of travel cost were not statistically significant at the .05
      level of significance. Tests of travel distance were not statistically significant at the.05
      level of significance. The mean point differentials of each contest during the first three
      rounds of the playoffs from 2002 – 2006 were calculated. Comparisons made between the average
      margin of victory for the playoffs as a whole, unaffected brackets, and affected brackets
      found the average margin of victory steadily decreased each round for the affected brackets
      and decreased then increased for the unaffected and overall brackets.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Approximately twelve hundred inscriptions attest to civic patrons within the Roman
      Empire, but only eighteen indicate that women received the honorary title of ‘patron of the
      community’ (patrona civitatis). The extant inscriptions are confined geographically to Italy,
      Africa Proconsularis, and Numidia, and are dated to between A.D. 180 and 350. The epigraphic
      record is the only evidence for the existence of civic patronae. This paper explores the
      interrelations, economic capabilities, and political ties of these women, focusing on the
      North African patronae civitatis. The epigraphic appearance of civic patronae was a product of
      a change in the institution of patronage to fit the economic needs of certain communities in
      Italy and North Africa, and their epigraphic disappearance denotes yet another shift in the
      mediation and commemorations of civic patronage. The ecclesiastical institutions that began to
      absorb communal responsibilities continued to commemorate female patrons, but in a more
      inconspicuous manner.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>While the study of the media and politics has become important to the discipline,
      little is know about how local political issues are depicted by newspapers. Building a theory
      derived from the communications and political science literature, the political and
      demographic environment of a city should shape the reporting of local political conflict in
      newspapers. Using an original data set, the results empirically confirm some aspects of the
      existing literature while offering new insights into the exact mechanisms behind the reporting
      of local political conflict.</mods:abstract>

      transformación psicológica que cada uno de los protagonistas de El mismo mar de todos los
      veranos de Esther Tusquets y La Rambla paralela de Fernando Vallejo experimenta en el “proceso
      de individuación” a lo largo de su vida. Desde la perspectiva de la psicología analítica, este
      estudio se beneficia de la extrapolación de los procesos mentales al plano político y social
      del que surgen las novelas. El análisis de las dos obras rebasa las constricciones de una
      mirada meramente individual para incorporar las ideas de nación y sociedad. De este modo, el
      estudio psicológico de los dos textos permite acceder al ámbito de la memoria traumática que
      subyuga a naciones con procesos problemáticos de cambio como Colombia y España.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The following study aims to fill a void in Yeatsian scholarship by investigating the
      under-analyzed link between William Butler Yeats’ late poetic production and the work of the
      medieval Florentine poet Dante Alighieri (1265-1321), focusing primarily but not exclusively
      on Yeats’ poem The Second Coming. An overview of Yeats’ reception of Dante’s literary corpus
      highlights a constant and constantly increasing interest in the Florentine poet’s work on the
      part of the Irish writer. Close attention is paid to the role of Dante in Yeats’ problematic
      esoteric volume A Vision, both as a ‘character’ within the work itself and as a shaping force
      behind the famous ‘system’ which the work outlines, and which serves as the
      theoretical/ideological backbone for all of Yeats’ successive poetic output. Finally, this
      study attempts a detailed search for Dantean traces in The Second Coming, arguably Yeats’ most
      read poem and one that has been called an emblem and a microcosm of all his late poetry. An
      analysis of the passages from Inferno that serve as a backdrop for The Second Coming’s imagery
      reveals how this lyric incorporates Dantean elements to a far greater degree than has been
      observed to this point. Furthermore, a look at the poem’s process of revision reveals how the
      work, from the earliest manuscript drafts to the final version, was progressively brought
      closer to Dantean models and tones.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Building on prior scholarship, this paper examines social responses to development
      projects along the northern part of the Ganges River and argues that they can be seen as a
      defense of place, embodied by nature, along a river that is culturally, religiously, and
      ecologically significant. By studying two development projects along the northern part of the
      Ganges in the colonial and the post-colonial eras, this discussion attempts to understand the
      ways that modernity, via colonialism and capitalism, transformed human relationships with the
      river. By focusing on the opposition to canal irrigation and the construction of the Tehri
      dam, I suggest that the inhabitants near the river were not against development as long as
      they perceived they could maintain their varied connections with the river. The two cases
      indicate, therefore, possibilities for the inclusion of multiple modernities and other ways of
      being and acting with respect to natural entities.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In his 2003 paper “How Truth Governs Belief” Nishi Shah claims that within first
      personal doxastic deliberation, one cannot separate the questions whether to believe some
      proposition p and whether p is true; the questions must be viewed as answered by and
      answerable to the same set of considerations. He calls this phenomenon transparency, and
      argues that the only way to explain it is by understanding the concept of belief as being
      normatively tied to truth. In deliberating about whether to believe we exercise our concept of
      belief, appreciate it’s normative connection to truth, and so incite the collapse of these two
      questions. By way of offering a response to Shah, I argue on behalf of teleological accounts
      of belief that there is a competing explanation of transparency. Despite Shah’s dilemma, it
      seems to me that the teleologist, making metaphysical rather than conceptual claims, can
      recover an explanation of why truth is normative for belief in the way transparency reveals.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>RasGRP3 is a novel endothelial diacylglycerol (DAG) receptor expressed in developing
      blood vessels. Because DAG levels are elevated in diabetes, I hypothesized a role for RasGRP3
      in the embryonic response to disrupted DAG signaling. Using whole embryo culture, I
      ascertained differences between wildtype embryos and embryos genetically deleted for RasGRP3
      exposed to excess glucose or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a compound that mimics the
      effects of diacylglycerol. Wildtype embryos exhibited numerous vascular and nonvascular
      defects when cultured with excess glucose and increased severity of defects when cultured with
      PMA, most notably in the yolk sac vasculature. Deletion of RasGRP3 partially protected embryos
      from defects experienced by wildtype embryos cultured with PMA or glucose. I also analyzed
      embryos developing in a maternal diabetic environment induced by streptozotocin injection. In
      this system, wildtype embryos had defects similar to those seen in embryo culture studies,
      while embryos deleted for RasGRP3 were partially protected.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In eighteenth century France, both Montesquieu and Choderlos de Laclos tackled the
      question of women’s place in society and the notion of female liberation in their epistolary
      novels, Les Lettres Persanes and Les Liaisons Dangereuses. In creating two strong female
      protagonists who launch personal attacks on the men who surround them, both authors
      demonstrate the potential threat that women posed to the male hierarchy if females were to
      recognize their power and unleash it. Though neither heroine fully succeeds in launching her
      battle against the society that enslaved them, each makes a case for female freedom and
      embodies their author’s views on the French regime of absolute monarchy, as is the case with
      Montesquieu, and the state of women in general, as is the case with Laclos.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>There is a popular thesis regarding the relationship between macrostates and
      microstates called ‘supervenience’. In roughly the first half of this paper, I argue that
      supervenience, despite its intuitive appeal, is false. I claim that microstates do not, contra
      supervenience, determine macrostates, but rather, that macrostates are determined by
      probability distributions over microstates. In the second half of this paper, I spend time
      exploring, clarifying, and defending this view. I conclude that, while more work must be done
      than I can do here to adequately defend my favored replacement for the supervenience thesis,
      it is a prima facie plausible and promising view.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Numerous animals embark on long-distance migrations, during which some of these
      animals can use the Earth’s magnetic field as a cue in orientation and navigation. Here, I
      study how loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings (Caretta caretta) use geomagnetic cues to guide
      themselves during their migration around the north Atlantic gyre, a current system that
      encircles the Sargasso Sea. My results suggest that hatchling turtles can use regional
      magnetic fields from numerous locations along the northern segment of their migratory pathway
      as open ocean guideposts. Exceptions may exist, however, in cases where regional fields have
      changed significantly in the recent past because of secular variation. My results also suggest
      that the magnetic field in which sea turtle eggs incubate influences the hatchlings’
      subsequent ability to use regional fields for navigation. This finding has important
      implications for sea turtle conservation, as anthropogenic magnetic anomalies encountered by
      developing hatchlings at nesting beaches might disrupt their magnetic navigation abilities
      later in life.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>What are the incentives and disincentives for poor-country governments to improve
      information systems to Manage for Development Results (MfDR)? This paper argues that the main
      incentive is the recognition of long-term benefits of MfDR approaches and tools for social
      welfare. MfDR can increase the inclusiveness of government interests, improve decision making
      for policy and implementation, and help address information asymmetry problems. Disincentives
      arise especially out of weak governance capacity and narrow interests. Narrow interests may
      seek to maintain the status quo creating low demand and possibly opposition. A poor country is
      more likely to move towards results-based management approaches if political leaders are
      convinced to take a long-run perspective, and bureaucrats given appropriate incentives to
      address short-term costs and provide security. This paper considers a range of material and

               <mods:abstract>The 2006 Presidential race was a watershed for the Belarusian independent press
      because the government embarked on cleansing the independent print journalism that had emerged
      in 1991, when the country became independent from the Soviet Union. The election was also
      marked by the transition of some independent newspapers from print to online and the vibrant
      development of citizen journalism in the Belarusian cyberspace. Based on a case study
      approach, this Master’s thesis explores the demise of the traditional press and the emergence
      of new alternative sources of information that tried to substitute for the silenced
      traditional media in Belarus during the period of the 2006 Presidential Election campaign,
      from October 2005 to March 25, 2006.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the way in which Tzotzil women, as featured
      in the book of poems Conjuros y ebriedades, are renegotiating Mayan tradition to position
      themselves in the future in accord with the feminist ideals of the EZLN at the global,
      communal, and household levels. The focus of the global aspect is on the way in which the
      poets are appropriating the exotic rendition of the “ethnic” from the Western perspective to
      attract international attention. The chapter addressing the fact that these women are
      appealing to traditions within their community specifically discusses their identification
      with the land and social conventions regarding the institution of marriage. At the household
      level, the following chapter then continues with this presiding notion of matrimony and
      addresses the prevalence of domestic violence and its effects within the family.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis is concerned with the bridges forged between a spiritual realm and the
      everyday—the experience of transcendence. This bridging is explored within the particular
      experiences of members of Hollow Springs and Philadelphia Primitive Baptist Churches in
      Caldwell County, North Carolina, who gather each Sunday for song, prayer, and the Word.
      Entering the church building as individuals, they become a spiritual group, bound through
      their individual and collective spiritual and worship experiences. The goal is unity in the
      Spirit, through the Spirit as it dwells within each congregant. It is communication with God
      and communication with one another through God—spiritual knowledge and understanding, eyes to
      see and ears to hear, a soul-soothing foretaste of eternal salvation and immortal glory in
      Jesus Christ. It is a brief experience in the sacred realm of the Holy Spirit. This, while
      often resisting description through mere words, is the nature of experiences explored herein.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>New U-Pb geochronology and mapping indicate that emplacement of the Lamarck
      Granodiorite of the John Muir Intrusive Suite, Sierra Nevada batholith, California was
      punctuated by two intervals of high magma flux approx. 2 m.y. apart. Existing geochronology
      indicates that a significant volume of the Lamarck intruded at 92 Ma, yet nearly
      indistinguishable zircon ages from four mappable pulses within the Dusy Basin area define an
      earlier episode of rapid intrusion around 94 Ma. Preservation of steeply dipping internal
      contacts at both map and outcrop scales requires that the earlier flux of magmatism included
      multiple discrete pulses. A new zircon age of 95.4 ± 0.3 Ma, along with textural and
      structural similarities, suggests that the Inconsolable Monzodiorite represents the oldest and
      most mafic member of the Muir suite. As a whole, the Muir suite was intruded episodically
      between 95 and 88 Ma.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to determine: 1) if an athlete’s age significantly
      affects neuropsychological test performance, 2) if an athlete’s performance remains consistent
      across serial neuropsychological tests, and 3) the concurrent validity of the Immediate
      Postconcussion and Cognitive Test (ImPACT) scores when compared to traditional paperpencil
      test scores of similar cognitive domains. A healthy sample of 20 college and 20 high school
      athletes completed both ImPACT and traditional paper-pencil neuropsychological test batteries
      on three separate occasions. Means and standard deviations, 2x3 mixed model ANOVAs (age x
      session), reliability (ICC2,1) and precision (SEM) values, and linear regressions were
      calculated on outcome measures for both test batteries. The ANOVAs revealed significant main
      effects of age for the Trail Making Test Form B (TMT-B) total time and ImPACT processing speed
      composite score with college athletes performing better than high school students on both
      measures. The ANOVAs also revealed significant main effects of session for the Brief
      Visuospatial Memory Test – Revised (BVMT-R) total recalled (immediate and delayed), the TMT-B
      total time, Stroop Test total score, and ImPACT processing speed composite score. Reliability
      measures ranged from 0.12 to 0.72 with the majority of the outcome measures achieving a
      moderate level of reliability across testing iii sessions. Linear regressions revealed that
      ImPACT test scores had low levels of shared variance with select paper-pencil
      neuropsychological tests. Coefficients of determination for these linear regressions left much
      of the variance unexplained (52-88%). Only the ImPACT Three Letters average counted correctly
      reached a moderate level (R2=0.481). This study demonstrates the need of the clinician to
      understand the differences in neuropsychological test performance for athletes of different
      age groups and across serial neuropsychological tests. It is also recommended that caution be
      exhibited when evaluating ImPACT test results of athletes 15-17 and 19-21 as the concurrent
      validity has not been conclusively proven.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis’ objective is to offer a personal interpretation of Carlo Levi’s
      narrative, Cristo si è fermato a Eboli. This thesis evaluates Levi’s narrative according to a
      specific reading of the modern, realist novel. This dialogue evaluates Levi’s narrative as
      providing textual evidence for a work in realism as conceived by Giacomo Debenedetti. This
      thesis further addresses the questione meridionale by means of engaging the text with the
      theory of Antonio Gramsci. The following chapters elaborate on the capacity of the narrative’s
      subject to speak to a current, socioeconomic situation generating an evaluation that speaks to
      fundamental elements of the questione meridionale. This thesis examines in what way a
      distinctive aesthetic evaluation of Carlo Levi reaffirms the novel as a realist text as
      conceived by Giacomo Debenedetti. This thesis’ ultimate aesthetic evaluation considers Levi’s
      narrative as speaking to the specific reality of the Italian-American community.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between facility upgrades,
      recruiting success as determined through national rankings and overall winning percentages for
      major Division I-A football programs. Through a review of available literature, two major
      viewpoints were discovered. One viewpoint was that facility building creates recruiting
      advantages and improves program success, the other being that the ongoing arms race
      compromises the academic mission of a university. The results of the statistical analysis
      demonstrated that there was a relationship between national recruiting ranking and facility
      building as well as national recruiting ranking and overall winning percentage.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The current studies, using eye-tracking methodology, sought to investigate the notion
      that processing difficulty may occur when reading sentences in which two or more noun phrases
      are encountered before they are integrated with verbs. This difficulty may be alleviated if
      the noun phrases are sufficiently dissimilar. Relative clauses (RC) and clefts, which can
      present readers with two or more noun phrases before the verbs which integrate them into the
      rest of sentence, were used to test this notion. Evidence for increased processing difficulty
      was found in Experiments 1 and 2 when two similar, but not dissimilar noun phrases were
      encountered before any verbs. Additionally, Experiment 3 utilized concurrent load methodology
      to test the possibility that the working memory responsible for language comprehension is
      modularized from general working memory. Experiment 3 provided evidence in support of
      similarity-based working memory and in opposition to the notion of modularized language
      comprehension working memory.</mods:abstract>

      peninsular Thailand from the middle of the nineteenth century to the 1980s, in order to
      rectify the image of the Chinese middleman in Southeast Asia as the evil “blood suckers”;
      furthermore, to demonstrate the heterogeneity inside the Chinese community in Southeast Asia,
      and the hierarchical structure and mobility within a specific trade; in addition, to emphasize
      the significance of personal trust and credit relationships embedded in particular exchange
      relations, in the traditional markets characterized by contract uncertainty where the legal
      framework for the enforcement of contracts is not well developed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study seeks to apply indices of entitativity taken from Campbell’s ideas
      concerning the status of social aggregates (1958) to the interindividual-intergroup
      discontinuity effect. Common fate, similarity, and proximity were manipulated as participants
      play a prisoner’s dilemma game. Entitativity was considered to be behaviorally evidenced when
      participants made higher proportions of competitive choices. Increased competition was found
      for both individuals interacting with groups and groups interacting with individuals in the
      presence of common fate consistent with the body of literature. A two-way interaction for
      groups interacting with individuals was found in which proximity accentuated the effect of
      common fate. Perceived entitativity was not found to significantly mediate any of these
      effects.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Increased sugar-sweetened beverage (SB) consumption and declining physical activity
      (PA) are linked to the rising obesity rates in children. This study seeks to determine if the
      transition from elementary to middle school has an impact on the relationships between changes
      in SB consumption, PA, and body mass index percentile (BMI%). At baseline and two years later,
      100 subjects (50 elementary and 50 moving to middle school) reported SB consumption, PA level,
      and had height and weight measured. Frequency of SB consumption and BMI% did not change over
      the two-year period within or between groups (p&gt;0.05). PA dropped in the transition
      group (p&lt;0.0001) and was different from the elementary group at year two
      (p&lt;0.01). The shift into middle school is an important period during which efforts
      should be made to maintain PA and prevent SB consumption from rising further.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this paper, Leo Bersani’s critical writings are brought to bear on Stanley
      Kubrick’s The Shining (1980). Exploring ideas about coupling, relationality, subjectivity and
      cinema, in this paper Bersani’s account of aesthetic engagement is both affirmed and
      reinflected. Ingmar Bergman’s Scenes from a Marriage (1973), The Shining, and an online parody
      trailer called “Shining” are examined. These films reveal narrative cinema’s difficulties in
      mounting a potent critique of coupling. Bersani’s writings propose that cinema best offers not
      a critique of coupling, but a relational model for a mode of being in the world. This mode of
      being, enabled by “the communication of forms,” is an alternative to our usual mode, governed
      by “the enigmatic signifier.” However, we can survive in either of these modes only through an
      oscillation between the two.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper uses Southern Baptist missionary records to examine the first twentyfive
      years of Pentecostalism in Brazil. Considering not only at what the first Pentecostal
      missionaries did but also what they did not do, it argues that the extraordinary success of
      the Brazilian Pentecostal movement is due in large part to the following reasons: early
      Pentecostals had neither the funds nor the theological need to focus on education, their
      personal class affiliations did not incline them to privilege efforts to evangelize the upper
      classes, there was no strong female Pentecostal missionary presence, and the Pentecostals had
      been preceded by mainline Protestant missionaries like the Baptists. Without schools to run
      and reports to write, Pentecostals were free to do the kind of one-on-one evangelizing that
      the Baptists had hoped to do but found they had little time for, intentionally stealing many
      of the Baptists’ flock in the process.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Anterior cruciate ligament injuries are more common in females than in males. Research
      has failed to isolate a cause for this bias. Hormones have been implicated in increased injury
      rates, increased ligamentous laxity, decreased stiffness, and increased electro-mechanical
      delay. We compared active and passive muscle stiffness, electromechanical delay, and
      extensibility of the knee flexor group between menses and ovulation in eumenorrheic women. No
      significant differences in active and passive muscle stiffness, electromechanical delay, or
      extensibility of the knee flexor group were measured between menses and ovulation. Menstrual
      cycle phase may not have an effect on active and passive muscle stiffness, electromechanical
      delay, or extensibility. Therefore, increased anterior cruciate ligament injury rates in
      females may not be caused by hormonal changes in muscle stiffness.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>After nearly a century of flood policies in the U.S., losses have continued to
      increase. This thesis examined the potential increase in losses related to the 100-yr
      floodplain, which is the minimum standard for implementing policies. Despite this core role,
      as much as 1.5 vertical meters of uncertainty exists when delineating the boundray. However,
      no uncertainty is provided on flood maps, which could result in increased socioeconomic
      exposure adjacent to the boundary when a larger flood occurs. This thesis quantified the
      effectiveness of mitigation from 1990 to 2000 for five North Carolina counties by examining
      changes in exposure inside and adjacent to the 100-yr floodplain. Findings indicated
      mitigation efforts have been effective inside the 100-yr floodplain; however, there was a
      significant increase in exposure adjacent to this floodplain. Stream scale analyses indicated
      mitigation effectiveness was influenced by stream size, distance from the stream, and location
      in urban versus rural areas.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to determine the validity, reliability and precision of
      the Palpation Meter while measuring scapular position in overhead athletes and to establish
      differences in scapular position with dominant shoulders versus non-dominant shoulders in
      overhead. A correlation analyses was used to determine if there was a relationship between
      laboratory and clinical measures of scapular position in twenty-nine Division I or
      recreational college-age overhead athletes. Intra Class Correlation and SEM values were used
      to determine the intratester reliability and precision of the Palpation Meter. Lastly, a
      paired t-test was used to determine the differences in scapular position at rest and 90° of
      abduction in dominant shoulder versus non-dominant. The Palpation Meter was found to be valid,
      reliable and precise when measuring scapular position at rest. The dominant scapular position
      of an overhead athlete was significant upwardly rotated, scapular upward/downward rotation,
      anterior/posterior tipping, and pectoralis minor length.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This paper aims to address how political competition can be theoretically
      comprehended, and what accounts for the variance in the content of political competition in
      different European polities. To answer these questions, it builds on spatial theory of
      politics, and develops two additional concepts: political space and axis of competition.
      Political space is understood as a landscape of contested political issues, which combine into
      a small number of dimensions, while the axis of competition depicts the particular combination
      of issues disputed in a given political system. After conceptualizing these terms, the paper
      addresses the empirical expression of political space and axis of competition in Europe.
      Finally, this work analyzes individual vote choice, underlining the linkage between individual
      political preferences and the variation of axes of competition across the European continent.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This series of articles is designed to help readers understand the role of risk
      factors in cancer diagnoses and to determine what approach is best for them when faced with
      their own risk factors for disease. The first article, “A Cancer Primer: Understanding
      Cancer’s Causes and Treatments and the Role of Risk Factors,” includes a simplified
      explanation of cancer and is accompanied by a graphic outlining basic cell division. “A Cancer
      Primer” introduces the reader to up-to-date research and expectations for future research, and
      to explanations of motives for behavior change. Articles two and three, “One Man’s Cancer” and
      “Choosing to Live with Risk Factors,” explain the choices of two men who’ve made very
      different decisions about behavior change based on cancer risk information. Lastly, the final
      article, “Information and Misinformation” can be used as a sidebar or a stand-alone piece. It
      guides readers to reliable and accurate cancer information and gives them tips for evaluating
      cancer-related information on the Internet.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis examines childhood asthma in Orange County, North Carolina and its
      relationship to the Hygiene Hypothesis. The Hygiene Hypothesis challenges traditionally held
      views on hygiene and asserts that decreased exposures to microbes during an infant’s first
      year of life results in the poor development of the immune system. According to this
      hypothesis, the lack of development in the immune system is at least partially responsible for
      the increasing number of autoimmune disorders, asthma being one of them. In addition to the
      cross-sectional analysis, spatial analysis is used to determine spatial patterning or
      clustering of childhood asthma cases in the county. A cross-sectional study was conducted
      including 427 households (1000 children). First and fourth grade households were surveyed via
      the Orange County School System. Geographic information was voluntarily collected on each
      household that participated. The results of the survey demonstrate that the primary factors
      impacting childhood asthma in Orange County are genetics, premature birth, daycare attendance,
      and urban/suburban living. Spatial analysis reveals areas of high prevalence in the county but
      clusters of questionable significance.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Although standard treatment improves survival for acute leukemia patients, development
      of treatment side effects is of major concern. Therefore, it is important to explore the
      impact of adjunct therapies, such as exercise, in mitigating treatment-related side effects.
      The primary purpose of this study was to examine the effects of exercise on selected fitness
      parameters and fatigue in acute leukemia patients undergoing treatment. A secondary purpose
      was to examine the relationship between changes in selected fitness parameters and fatigue.
      Ten patients with acute leukemia participated in this study. Exercise protocol included
      aerobic, resistance, and flexibility performed 3 times/week for 6 weeks. Significant changes
      in cardiovascular endurance and overall fatigue (p = 0.009 for both), with no changes in
      overall muscular endurance (p= 0.715) were observed. In conclusion, the results of this study
      suggest that administration of exercise during the leukemia treatment promotes improvement of
      cardiovascular endurance, maintenance of muscular endurance and reduction in fatigue levels.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>What effect does the presence of religious terms in adolescent discourse and the
      availability of religious organizations that serve as entry points to community service
      opportunities have on the rate of adolescent volunteerism? 252 interviews from the National
      Study of Youth and Religion (NSYR) data set were coded to analyze how religious orientations
      and religious affiliations influenced how adolescents talked about their volunteer and
      community experiences. Specifically, responses were coded and analyzed whenever teens used
      religious references or concepts (“God Talk”) or referred to religious organizations as being
      their entry points into volunteering (“Gateways”). 225 of the sample of 252 adolescents (89%)
      expressed “God Belief” or said they believed in God, a Higher Power, or some sort of Force.
      With the religious variable “God Talk” introduced the number of teenagers who volunteer
      increases. When God Talk and Religious Gateway are exhibited together more teens volunteer.
      The presence of these religious variables correlates with higher levels of volunteerism Out of
      a total number of 254 Gateways (entry points to volunteerism), 151 (59%) Gateways were
      associated with God Talk and 103 (41%) were not associated with God Talk. Thus, volunteer
      rates were highest when God Talk and Religious Gateways were present.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis concerns the effects of family structure in childhood and adolescence on
      cohabitation in young adulthood as a first union. In the United States, cohabitation has
      become more common as a first union in recent decades, and over half of people cohabit before
      their first marriage. Prior studies show that family life experiences have significant effects
      on a child’s own family formation. This study examines the effects of family structure in
      childhood on young adults’ first union formation, focusing on the choice of cohabitation over
      marriage and singlehood. The results show that cohabitation is promoted by (1) reduced
      education, (2) experiencing parental cohabitation, (3) living in an alternative family growing
      up, and (4) experiencing higher number of family status changes. Male unemployment, welfare
      allowance, religion and religiosity, race/ethnicity, and parental education also had
      significant influence on young adults’ cohabitation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis examines the factors that contribute the public’s opinion of Congress. I
      posit that conflict, whether it is actual conflict or merely the perception of conflict, has
      the significant negative affect on approval of Congress. Other factors taken into
      consideration include divided government, presidential approval, and economic expectations.
      For measures of conflict, I used both a measure of perceived conflict (negative media
      coverage) and a measure of actual internal conflict (congressional party unity scores.) My
      results show that perceived conflict can negatively affect opinion. The evidence presented
      above supports my hypothesis that conflict in Congress makes people uncomfortable and angry
      with their government producing negative opinions of this branch of government. Media coverage
      may exacerbate this phenomenon. By overemphasizing conflict that does exist, the media may
      play a role in the reason Congressional approval is so low in general.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>An investigation of nitrogen export and the potential of restoration as a tool for
      water quality management in catchments along an urban-rural gradient. Quantity of N exported
      and flow conditions dominating N export are investigated. These variables are of interest as
      stream restorations typically aim to increase retention under low-moderate flow. We present a
      metric characterizing export flow distribution, F75, and develop regressions relating F75 to
      development. We extrapolate F75 across a stream network to identify areas where export flow
      distribution is most favorable for restoration. We then examine potential to increase N
      retention via restoration. We develop post-restoration N export estimates for a range of
      uptake velocities (vf ). Results show drainage area is a dominant explanatory variable for
      reduction; F75 may be an important factor within drainage area. Reductions at vf comparable to
      other restorations were low, suggesting limited potential for water quality improvement.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>There has recently been a sharp increase in support for anti-immigrant policies in
      Europe. This paper tests whether this increase can be explained by an in-group insularity
      (rooted in Social Identity Theory) felt by traditional natives toward immigrants, or whether
      it acts in tandem with perceived economic and demographic threat (rooted in Realistic Group
      Conflict Theory). I ran a cross-sectional OLS model that incorporated both in-group insularity
      and perceived threat across 14 European countries individually, and then a cross-national
      analysis controlling for state-level factors. The results demonstrated that in-group
      insularity is more powerful in explaining support for antiimmigrant policies than perceived
      threat.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>English loanwords are presently entering the Russian language, often replacing their
      native counterparts. This thesis addresses the question of why Russian speakers adopt English
      loanwords instead of using the existing native counterparts. By utilizing content analysis of
      word frequency data from the Russian national corpus, this thesis demonstrates that loanwords
      and their counterparts often have some semantic differences. These differences are revealed by
      examining the meaning and frequency of adjectives collocated with loanwords and their
      counterparts. Some adjectives are more likely to collocate with a loanword but not its
      counterpart, often resulting in narrowing of originally broad loanword meaning into a niche
      meaning. When an English loanword and its Russian counterpart have different meanings, the
      loanword has an advantage in lexical competition, and is therefore more likely to be adopted
      and used by Russian speakers. This thesis presents an objective and quantifiable method of
      determining such an advantage.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This pilot study used a descriptive case-study method, with multiple cases, to examine
      changes in students’ self-perceptions and performance in writing. The study focused on the
      effects of an intervention, intended to impact components of motivational engagement (interest
      and writing apprehension) as well as self-efficacy beliefs, for students with cognitive
      strengths and learning deficits, in order to determine how this relates to levels of effort
      and persistence on writing tasks. The participants were two adolescent students, who exhibited
      cognitive strengths, coupled with learning disabilities in writing. The study design used
      Entry Phase and Exit Phase measures to collect data on the students’ levels of self-efficacy,
      apprehension, and interest in writing, before and after the intervention. Additional measures
      of effort, persistence, and performance were also taken at Entry and Exit Phases. Findings
      indicated improvements for both students on levels of effort, persistence, and performance
      following the intervention.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This article explores how narratives of the collapse of Enron Corp. were informed and
      influenced by the attacks of September 11, 2001, which occurred just a few months prior.
      Directly and indirectly, consciously and unconsciously, people describing the bankruptcy from
      a variety of angles made frequent analogies to “9-11” through imagery of implosion and
      collapse, and by comparing and even equating the causes and consequences of each of these
      “devastating” events. Developing the concept of “tangled narratives,” the study discusses how
      the Enron and September 11 narratives might best be understood as inter-tangled, and ends with
      a reflection on the idea of the tangle as a methodological tool in History and the study of
      culture and narrative.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Chapter One: Copper-Catalyzed Electrophilic Amination of Organozinc Nucleophiles The
      copper-catalyzed electrophilic amination of diorganozinc reagents using Obenzoyl
      hydroxylamines as electrophilic nitrogen sources has been developed. Simple and functionalized
      aryl-, heteroaryl-, benzyl, n-alkyl-, s-alkyl-, and t-alkyl nucleophiles couple with
      R2NOC(O)Ph and RHNOC(O)Ph reagents in the presence of catalytic quantities of copper salts to
      provide tertiary and secondary amines, respectively, in generally good yields. In many cases
      the product may be isolated analytically pure after a simple extractive workup. The amination
      process is shown to tolerate a significant degree of steric demand. The amination of nominally
      unreactive Caryl-H bonds via a sequential directed ortho metalation/transmetalation/catalytic
      amination reaction sequence is detailed. The direct Cu-catalyzed amination of Grignard
      reagents using cocatalysis by ZnCl2 is described. Chapter Two: Nickel-Catalyzed Electrophilic
      Amination of Organozinc Nucleophiles The nickel-catalyzed electrophilic amination of
      organozinc halides using Obenzoyl hydroxylamines has been developed. Simple and functionalized
      aryl-, benzyl, and n-alkyl- nucleophiles couple with R2NOC(O)Ph reagents in the presence of
      catalytic quantities of Ni(PPh3)2Cl2 to provide tertiary amines in generally good yields. The
      reaction is noteworthy for the mild reaction conditions employed and the ease of product
      purification (acid/base extractive work-up). Chapter Three: Electrophilic Amination of
      o-Nitrobenzyl Silanes The electrophilic amination of o-nitrobenzyl silanes using di-tert-butyl
      azodicarboxylate as electrophilic nitrogen source and catalytic tetrabutylammonium fluoride as
      activator has been developed. A wide variety of á-alkyl and 4’- substituted onitrobenzyl
      silanes couple with di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate in the presence of catalytic quantities of
      tetrabutylammonium fluoride to provide N-benzyl hydrazides in good yields.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Household preparedness can help save lives and curtail staggering losses from natural
      disasters around the world. Finding ways to promote preparedness has become urgent in
      developing countries, which bear an increasingly disproportionate share of losses. Social
      capital reflects the quality of human relationships and may provide a useful resource to
      encourage households to prepare before it is too late. This study examines the influence of
      social capital on three aspects of household disaster preparedness: awareness of protective
      measures, knowledge of evacuation procedures and familiarity with response agencies. Two
      theoretical approaches to social capital are considered at the household-level: 1) relational
      social capital reflects the resources embedded in personal networks and is defined by resource
      composition, resource diversity and kinship composition; and 2) community social capital
      refers to the features of social organization (e.g., networks, norms and social trust) that
      promote cooperation within a group. Government representatives, civil society organizations in
      charge of disaster preparedness and community and household characteristics are also posited
      to influence household preparedness. Key informant interviews and a 182-household survey in 6
      villages in Dominica in the Caribbean were used to assess the influence of relational and
      community social capital for locally-relevant measures of the three aspects of household
      preparedness. Results were analyzed for each outcome using logistic regression. The study.s
      key findings support that social capital enhances household preparedness and that this
      influence is moderate to strong relative to other factors. The effects of relational and
      community social capital, however, are distinct and furthermore vary across aspects of
      preparedness. Moreover, only resource diversity and to some extent kinship composition prove
      valuable characteristics of social networks. Diverse and kin-centered networks are valuable
      for awareness of protective measures. Networks with more diversity further enhance knowledge
      of evacuation procedures. Community social capital, on the other hand, improves familiarity
      with response agencies. In addition to emphasizing the importance of relationships among
      people for disaster preparedness, this study provides much needed empirical evidence
      contrasting two widely-used approaches to social capital. Relational and community social
      capital correspond to different types of human interactions and have a different utility.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation examines how young private firms manage their entrepreneurial growth
      through the timing of their initial public offering (IPO). While previous research on IPOs has
      predominantly assumed that the process of “going public” should be timed to maximize financial
      benefits, anecdotal evidence has shown that the timing of IPOs also has competitive
      implications for firms’ strategic growth. Specifically, this study examines whether firms
      determine the timing of their IPO launch in accordance with what the theory of entrepreneurial
      action or real options reasoning would suggest, and how strategic considerations such as
      competition in both the product market and stock market influences such timing decisions.
      Integrating the theory of entrepreneurial action and real options reasoning, competing
      hypothesis are developed in which strategic considerations such as product market and stock
      market uncertainty will induce firms to either accelerate or defer the timing of their IPO
      launch depending on the influence of the venture capitalists. The timing of the IPO launch is
      also influenced by the level of competition in the product and stock market, as well as the
      irreversibility of the IPO decision. The analyses showed clear support for the direct
      relationship between uncertainty and the timing of IPO: when faced with uncertainty in the
      product market, firms act in accordance with what the theory of entrepreneurial action would
      suggest, however, when faced with uncertainty in the stock market, firms act in accordance
      with what the theory of real options reasoning would suggest. Compared with firms with lower
      levels of involvement from venture capitalists, firms with higher levels of involvement of
      venture capitalists are likely to have an early IPO timing. The analysis also supported the
      assumption that the timing of IPO is also influenced by the existence of competition in the
      product market and stock market.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between attachment quality
      and expressed emotion (EE) among adult children caring for parents with dementia. EE has been
      shown to significantly impact care-recipient outcome across a wide variety of chronic
      conditions including dementia. However, it remains unclear why some caregivers respond to
      their care-recipients with high EE and others do not. A significant body of literature has
      demonstrated that attachment significantly guides caregiving behavior across a variety of
      relationships. The current study attempts to explore whether attachment may serve as a model
      for understanding EE among individuals caring for a parent with dementia. Additionally, the
      current study examines attribution style as a potential mediator of that relationship. One
      hundred individuals self-identified as the primary family caregiver of a parent or in-law with
      dementia participated in the study. Caregivers were sent a questionnaire packet and
      participated in a one hour telephone interview. Structural equation modeling was used to test
      the substantive hypotheses and revealed some support for a relationship between attachment and
      EE; however, the pattern of findings suggest that different relationships exist among the
      various aspects of attachment and EE. Additionally, the proposed mediational model was not
      supported. Results are discussed with reference to the different methods of assessing EE and
      attachment and how those differences may have impacted the observed relationships.
      Implications for future research and clinical intervention are also discussed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation charts transformations in social control mechanisms in a rural
      district of southeastern Cuba during the gradual demise of slavery into the opening decade of
      state formation in the twentieth century. It examines how changes wrought by slavery’s end
      concurrent with wars of national independence against Spanish colonial rule, and United States
      intervention into that conflict during 1898, shaped the Guantánamo jurisdiction from a
      colonial island frontier to a North American enclave. The study contributes to scholarship on
      shifts in racial constructs, citizenship, labor, and liberalism in New World Diaspora
      societies marked by legacies of coercive labor. Dissimilar and distinct military mobilizations
      of black soldiery were salient factors in the last three nations of the hemisphere to abandon
      their “peculiar institution” of slavery: the United States (the Civil War 1861-65), Brazil
      (the Paraguay War, 1864-70 with final abolition by 1888), and Cuba (the Ten Years’ War,
      1868-78 with final abolition in 1886). This project addresses implications of Cubans of color
      and former slaves engaged in anticolonial mobilizations during the island’s transformation
      from colony to republican nation-state. I argue that the rebellion against the metropolitan
      state challenged enduring local structures of domination and power, confronting but not
      overturning durable social control mechanisms designed to defend property and discipline the
      colonial order. By 1895, a cross-racial and cross-class tactical alliance rekindled the
      independence struggle against Spain and its local sources of power, extracting war taxes from
      landowners – an incipient politics of the social function of property. After U.S. occupation,
      and independence by 1902, that alliance did not last. In the newly constituted republic,
      political unrest that threatened property destruction and sabotage at sugar estates met with
      repression. The study ends with the first U.S. occupation, by which time new social forces and
      elite social control concerns accompanied Cuban independence and post independence politics.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The detection of early characteristics of autism and language impairments is critical
      in providing early interventions for a child with delays. Using a sample of 864 children in
      the Chapel Hill area, this study investigates the link between joint attention, imitation, and
      repetitive behaviors at 12 months and likelihood of displaying characteristics of autism or
      language delays at 24 months. Results indicated that joint attention, imitation, and
      repetitive behaviors were related to the display of characteristics of autism (p &lt;
      0.0001; p &lt; 0.002; p &lt; 0.0001) as well as for later language impairments (p
      &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.0001; p &lt; 0.027). Finally, within a sample of children who
      were determined at risk for autism, joint attention and imitation predicted language delays (p
      &lt; 0.0001; p &lt; 0.05). These findings formulate a better understanding of
      characteristics of autism and language delays in early childhood.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation investigates the transformation of identities of people who
      experience globalization through mass media in their local places. I explore how South Korean
      sports fans constitute individual and collective identities through enjoying global sports,
      i.e. Major League Baseball. This study examines both the process of globalizing MLB in South
      Korea in the late 90s and the ways that Korean MLB fan enjoy MLB through interacting with
      other fans in their online community. This study is concerned with three issues: global sports
      and nationalism/nationstates, global sports and national identity, and fans in an online
      community. First, using the experiences of Korean baseball fans as an exemplary case, this
      dissertation examines the issue of identity in a global era vis-à-vis the changing status of
      nationalism and the nation-states. Korean nationalism and the Korean government are still key
      influences in reconstituting the identities of Korean MLB fans. Particularly, mass media
      representations of MLB provided examples of national individuals as models for the altered
      nationalism of the late 1990s. Secondly, this dissertation investigates how the global sports
      are embedded in (re)constituting national identity among local people, and then how national
      identity has been transformed in this process. It focuses on global sports as a key element in
      national identity, the presence of national sentiment in MLB fandom in South Korea, and the
      transformation of “the structures of the national” among Korean MLB fans. Third, this
      dissertation examines an online community and its members, who are no longer limited to a
      geographical place but rather connect to each other based on common interest. Conclusively, I
      suggest the term “individuated nationalism” to explain the complicated merging of the national
      with the idea of individuality. The notion of individuated nationalism implies that, in South
      Korea, nationalism is embedded in people’s everyday lives, but it is chosen as a personal
      taste or even rationalized and justified as an identity rather than embraced as a moral
      imperative or ideological manipulation. Korean MLB fans utilize their national fandom as a
      source of individual identity based on personal experiences, memories, and the circumstances
      in which they consume MLB.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Structure and dynamics play crucial roles in many aspects of protein function. The
      detailed characterization of structure and dynamics of a protein is therefore critical for
      elucidation of its function. Despite the rapid advances in experimental methods, we are still
      much limited in our ability to characterize the structure and dynamics of a protein due to the
      resolution capability at length and time scales of the current methods. As complimentary
      approaches to the experimental methods, coarse-grained simulations based on simplified models
      offer unparallel opportunities for studying structure and dynamics that are hardly subject to
      direct experimental characterization. In this dissertation, we first develop a new methodology
      that enables the study of the meta-stable states of protein by incorporating hydrogen-exchange
      data derived from NMR experiments into coarse-grained simulations, and applied this method to
      characterize the folding intermediate of FAT domain. Second, we study large-scale
      conformational dynamics of vinculin and reveal new insights into allosteric control of its
      function. Third, we study the fidelity of protein structure reconstruction using inter-residue
      proximity constraints and rational strategies for constraint selection for protein structure
      determination.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation examines the representation of complex mother figures presented in
      Francophone literature. I focus my analysis on literature from three distinct Francophone
      regions: the French Caribbean, North Africa, and Quebec. Pluie et vent sur Télumée Miracle
      (1972) by Simone Schwarz-Bart and L'espérance-macadam (1995) and L'exil selon Julia (1996) by
      Gisèle Pineau put forth both positive and negative mother figures from Guadeloupe. La femme
      sans sépulture (2002) by Assia Djebar and Des rêves et des assassins (1995) by Malika
      Mokeddem depict the struggles of North African mothers and their children, both in Algeria and
      abroad. Finally, from Quebec, Ying Chen's L'Ingratitude (1995) and Abla Farhoud’s Le bonheur
      à la queue glissante (2004) demonstrate the repressive patriarchal structure that inhibits
      mother figures and has lasting repercussions in the lives of their children. Close reading of
      these texts reveals the multiple roles mothers play in postcolonial contexts, including
      primary breadwinner, guardian of culture, and participant in a war of liberation. In examining
      mother figures within and across various Francophone regions, this dissertation uncovers the
      complexities of the maternal role in transcultural societies. Drawing links between women of
      different continents, cultural heritages, and religious traditions, the study examines
      problematic issues pertaining to mother figures in postcolonial contexts, including those
      linked to exile, gender, and symbolic violence. I argue that the seven novels chosen for this
      dissertation resuscitate women’s forgotten voices. Furthermore, while recognizing the powerful
      role held by mother figures in certain circumstances, I uncover the nuances of the maternal
      figure, which point to the distinct disadvantages she experiences in postcolonial,
      transcultural societies, including but not limited to language barriers, isolation and
      repression by the patriarchy.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>East African savannas are persistent socio-ecological systems undergoing unprecedented
      change. This dissertation focuses on the emerging agro-pastoral system of Maasai herders in
      the savanna lands adjacent to Tanzania’s Tarangire National Park. As pastoralists adopt
      cultivation, the relationship between humans and the land is changed. The new dynamics
      threaten the resilience of savanna systems. I examine three aspects of the human ecology of
      Maasai subsistence: changes in territory and political ecology, changes to the local common
      property system resulting from territorial compression, and how Maasai are responding to the
      production constraints of cultivation. I employed ethnography, social surveys, soil surveys
      and livestock demography to take a political ecology approach to investigating
      human-environment relations. Maasai territory is being fragmented by forces from within and
      without Maasai society. Poverty is increasing, due to market integration, high cattle
      mortality and population growth. Despite this, the adoption of cultivation cannot be explained
      by poverty alone. Poverty interacts with land tenure insecurity and with environmental
      stochasticity to create conditions conducive to the adoption of cultivation. Subdivision
      fragments the pastures which support pastoralism, reducing mobility and flexibility critical
      to dryland ecosystems. A village zoning plan has led to the emergence of a new common property
      regime that appears sufficient for current grazing and cultivation needs yet the historical
      pattern of land allocation means some villagers have greater access to protected pastures and
      water than others. Rich soils from abandoned kraals are also unequally distributed across the
      landscape. Pastoralists must negotiate limited cultivation experience, wildlife raids and
      labor shortages to integrate pastoral and agricultural production. Several trends suggest
      negative repercussions for future resilience of the socioecological system. Unequal resource
      distribution among land allocations, the history of interactions between stakeholder groups,
      and land use patterns that inadvertently concentrate resources among a few households are
      decreasing the flexibility demanded by semi-arid systems. To reduce the nega tive effects of
      cultivation, efforts should focus on improving yields on small plots, supporting livestock
      husbandry and integrating local residents and wildlife interests to build a resilient future.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This study examined the process of change for a group of teachers who took part in the
      Schools Attuned (SA) Program: a professional development program designed to equip educators
      with the knowledge and skills to address the diverse learning needs of students. According to
      the literature on teacher change, the relationships between teacher professional development
      programs and changes in teachers’ beliefs and practices are quite complex. In order to shed
      light on the change processes triggered by the SA Program, this study drew on techniques of
      qualitative inquiry to gain an in-depth understanding of how individual teachers changed their
      behaviors and thinking during their first year of involvement with the program. The research
      questions driving this study focused on understanding how participants implemented the SA
      Program and how the program impacted participants’ thinking about their students and how
      students learn. These research questions dealt primarily with process as opposed to outcomes,
      making a qualitative approach the most appropriate mode of inquiry. The unit of analysis was
      the teachers themselves, although the contextual factors that impacted program use were also
      examined. Findings suggest two paths by which teacher change occurs, referred to as
      “selfsustained change” and “generative change,” and offers a number of implications for
      teacher professional development programs and future research in the area of teacher change.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation explores the notion of gendered resistance acts and writing through
      close readings of the personal narratives of three French women who experienced life in France
      during the Second World War. The works of Claire Chevrillon (Code Name Christiane Clouet: A
      Woman in the French Resistance), Marguerite Duras (La Douleur), and Lucie Aubrac (Ils
      partiront dans l’ivresse) challenge traditional definitions of resistance, as well as the
      notion that war, resistance and the writing of such can be systematically categorized
      according to the male/female dichotomy. These authors depict the day-to-day struggle of
      ordinary people caught in war, their daily resistance, and their ordinary as well as
      extraordinary heroism. In doing so, they debunk the stereotypes of war, resistance and heroism
      that are based on traditional military models of masculinity. Their narratives offer a more
      comprehensive view of wartime France than was previously depicted by Charles de Gaulle and
      post-war historians, thereby adding to the present debate of what constitutes history and
      historiography. Recent critical works on women and the Second World War have done much to
      document women’s resistance. Yet, these studies tend to highlight the distinctly feminine
      nature of women’s wartime resistance and narratives, ultimately reinforcing the established
      dichotomies based on gender difference. This dissertation suggests that women’s wartime
      narratives do not necessarily point to a feminization of war, resistance, history, and
      writing, but rather, to a more personalized representation of historical events based on
      individual experience, but which is still part of the historical discourse.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The rendering of photorealistic surface appearance is one of the main challenges
      facing modern computer graphics. Image-based approaches have become increasingly important
      because they can capture the appearance of a wide variety of physical surfaces with complex
      reflectance behavior. In this dissertation, I focus on surface light fields, an image-based
      representation of view-dependent and spatially-varying appearance. Constructing a surface
      light field can be a time-consuming and tedious process. The data sizes are quite large, often
      requiring multiple gigabytes to represent complex reflectance properties. The result can only
      be viewed after a lengthy post-process is complete, so it can be difficult to determine when
      the light field is sufficiently sampled. Often, uncertainty about the sampling density leads
      users to capture many more images than necessary in order to guarantee adequate coverage. To
      address these problems, I present several approaches to simplify the capture of surface light
      fields. The first is a “human-in-the-loop” interactive feedback system based on the online
      svd. As each image is captured, it is incorporated into the representation in a streaming
      fashion and displayed to the user. In this way, the user receives direct feedback about the
      capture process, and can use this feedback to improve the sampling. To avoid the problems of
      discretization and resampling, I used incremental weighted least squares, a subset of radial
      basis function which allows for incremental local construction and fast rendering on graphics
      hardware. Lastly, I address the limitation of fixed lighting by describing a system that
      captures the surface light field of an object under synthetic lighting.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation explores the origins of Strategic Air Command’s organizational
      culture. Organizational culture—the assumptions, values, and rituals of an organization— has
      an ideological and a material component. Formed in 1946, SAC inherited part of its
      organizational culture from the assumptions of Air Force leaders who believed that strategic
      air power should be organized under one independent commander. This provided the initial
      values and organizational doctrine for the command. The shared historical experiences of those
      who fought in World War II provided the formulation for the tactics and cultural rituals that
      became part of SAC culture. Constructing a ‘force-in-being’ meant preparing SAC to execute its
      war plan on a moment’s notice. Curtis LeMay put SAC on alert; war was not months or weeks but
      hours away. As SAC organized, trained, and, in the minds of its leaders and members fought the
      Cold War, other organizational routines, rituals, and symbols evolved. Many of SAC’s first
      cultural forms—standardized procedures, lead crews, and the survival school—grew out of the
      leaders’ shared experiences. Other cultural elements— security, competition, and architectural
      designs—developed out of the command’s involvement in the Cold War. Security and competition
      oriented people towards an enemy and to vigilance. Although SAC tried to build a family
      friendly command, its atmosphere of competition ran counter to the cooperation needed at home
      to maintain a healthy family life. In 1957, the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik I changed the
      circumstances of the Cold War and added new elements to SAC culture. Alert—the ability to
      launch bombers and ICBMs within fifteen minutes—became a cultural routine that lasted in SAC
      until the Cold War ended. The responsiveness required of the alert force meant mistakes,
      especially with nuclear weapons, were not tolerated. SAC culture dictated perfection as the
      standard. Missiles, however, stood in stark contrast to the values and assumptions of the
      organization. These new weapons were ‘pilotless.’ Therefore, SAC took measures to make sure
      this new SAC subculture espoused the same values and beliefs as the larger organization. SAC’s
      culture emphasized standardization, perfection, and the physical presentation of power because
      this was the type of war the organization fought.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The rapid spread of suburban and exurban development is dramatically altering
      landscapes across North Carolina, thereby threatening the ecological and cultural heritage of
      numerous rural communities. These communities typically lack the institutional capacity for
      organized response to landscape change, so rural residents who deplore the degradation of
      valued local assets often feel powerless to protect them. Conservation and land use planning
      advocates, meanwhile, have failed to involve most of these rural North Carolinians in natural
      resource management initiatives. In order to attract broader support, I argue that resource
      management agents must establish the relevance of their campaigns to the values, experiences,
      and concerns that rural community members share. Toward that end, I propose that natural
      resource management initiatives be designed with regard for local ecological discourses: ways
      in which members of a particular community socially construct their environment through
      communication. This study tested the hypotheses that 1) local discourses are ecologically
      interrelated with other elements of local ecosystems and therefore differ among communities
      and regions, and 2) arguments for collective natural resource management can garner
      broad-based community support if framed through these local discourses. I collaborated with
      local partners to conduct community projects at five sites in rural North Carolina. Four of
      the sites were located in the Piedmont region near Charlotte; the fifth site (Macon County)
      was located in the Mountain region. At each site, we employed an iterative participatory
      research model, in which analyses were repeatedly refined through community input. Through
      analysis of project data within and across sites and regions, I characterize discourse as an
      ecological phenomenon: its interactions with other ecosystem properties, as well as its
      within-site (alpha), between-site (beta) and regional/inter-regional (gamma) diversities. Then
      I present evidence that the salient narratives (shared stories) identified through each
      community project were persuasive to local community members at large, including those who had
      not previously participated in the projects. This study’s findings suggest that a discursive
      approach could improve resource management agents’ ability to help communities protect the
      landscapes they call home.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Late transition metal-catalyzed functionalization of organic substrates is a major
      focus of organometallic chemistry. In particular, mechanistic studies on the cationic Ni(II)
      and Pd(II) a-diimine catalyzed homo- and co-polymerization of ethylene and a-olefins and other
      polar comonomers revealed several key factors affecting catalyst activity, selectivity
      (polymerization vs. oligomerization vs. dimerization) and stability including large weakly
      coordinating anions and axial bulk. Separate studies on cationic Co(III) catalysts for the
      living polymerization of ethylene revealed that these electrophilic complexes also catalyze
      olefin hydrogenation, dimerization and hydrosilation. This dissertation focuses on mechanistic
      studies related to Pd(II) catalyzed ethylene oligomerization and Co(III) catalyzed olefin
      functionalization reactions. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis and characterization of a
      Pd(II) ethylene oligomerization catalyst derived from a sterically bulky, chiral
      phosphine-oxazoline ligand developed in the laboratory of Professor James Morken. This
      catalyst incorporates a moderate degree of steric bulk in the axial position of the Pd(II)
      square plane relative to that reported for the highly active Ni(II) and Pd(II) a-diimine
      olefin polymerization catalysts and the Ni(II) and Pd(II) ethylene dimerization catalysts
      possessing no axial bulk. Catalyst activity as a function of ethylene pressure and reaction
      temperature as well as investigation of reaction kinetics are discussed in the context of a
      proposed mechanism for ethylene oligomerization. The moderate degree of steric bulk imparted
      by the rigid ligand backbone over the axial position of the Pd(II) square plane is responsible
      for ethylene oligomerization activity. Mechanistic studies have established the mode of chain
      transfer. The synthesis and characterization of proposed reaction intermediates in olefin
      polymerization, hydrosilation and hydrogenation processes catalyzed by electrophilic
      Co(III)-alkyl complexes is the subject of Chapter 3. Cleavage of the Co-alkyl bond by
      dihydrogen or silane is postulated to proceed through either an oxidative addition – reductive
      elimination sequence or a s-bond metathesis pathway. To gain further insight into these two
      pathways, the reactions of cationic Co(III)-ethyl complexes with H2 and silanes have been
      examined. Low temperature 1H and 29Si NMR experiments used to establish the bonding
      interactions of these substitutionally labile and thermally unstable s-complex intermediates
      as well as relevant dynamic processes are described.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>“Mary as Media Icon: The Madonna in Twentieth-Century American Catholic Devotional
      Cultures” investigates the proliferation of Marian representations within the media of two
      U.S. Catholic devotional organizations, the Militia Immaculata, U.S.A., and the Central
      Association of the Miraculous Medal, at specific cultural and historical moments, specifically
      from 1917 to 1970. Both groups used media, particularly their magazines, Immaculata and The
      Miraculous Medal, to communicate their devotional messages and to represent the Virgin Mary in
      ways that expressed their distinctive views. While exploring this media, I found that
      twentieth-century Marian devotional organizations in the United States, such as the Militia
      Immaculata and the Association of the Miraculous Medal, adapted images of the Madonna to their
      religious, political, and historical subcultures through acts of creative representation
      intended to transform beliefs into actions. These representations became media icons—images
      that both signify and participate in the religious worldviews of Marian devotees. This
      dissertation employs the scholarly perspectives of Catholic Studies, American Religious
      History, Media Studies, and Critical Theory to interrogate the role of the Madonna in
      twentieth-century American Catholic devotional cultures.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Child welfare agencies face considerable challenges in making consistent and effective
      placement decisions for children coming to the attention of the child welfare system. Yet,
      available evidence suggests that agency workers and supervisors may not be adequately equipped
      to make these critical decisions alone. Team Decisionmaking (TDM) is an innovative approach to
      decision-making in child welfare that actively seeks the input of family, community members,
      and service providers in making placement decisions for children and families. Conceptually,
      TDM is designed to promote effective placement decisions at key decision points in the child
      welfare system by balancing consideration of families’ risk factors with protective factors
      that also may exist in families’ community networks. As one of the four “core strategies” of
      the Family to Family initiative sponsored by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, TDM has been
      implemented in child welfare agencies in 17 states. This dissertation focuses on (1)
      variations in scope and compliance of TDM implementation across sites; (2) the extent of
      implementation fidelity across sites; and (3) the degree to which TDM characteristics may be
      associated with placement recommendations for children in foster care. Findings suggest that
      in the study sites, TDM meetings are being implemented on a wide systemic scale and that
      family and community supports are attending a large percentage of meetings. Furthermore, a
      consistently strong pattern emerged regarding the influence of caregiver attendance in
      reducing the likelihood of recommendations to change foster care placements. Findings in these
      study sites are discussed in light of a conceptual framework that describes how risk and
      protective factors could be balanced in child welfare decision-making.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Retroviral genomes are assembled from two sense-strand RNAs by non-covalent
      interactions at their 5' ends, forming a dimer. Gag, a viral polyprotein, recruits and
      packages the retroviral dimer in a nascent virion. After export from the infected cell, the
      virus and its RNA dimeric genome undergo maturation, a process that renders the virus
      infective. Viral maturation is initiated by proteolytic cleavage of Gag into a set of
      constituent proteins including nucleocapsid (NC). Gag and nucleocapsid proteins both bind the
      RNA dimer at different stages of viral development with exquisite specificity. Genomic RNA
      dimerization and packaging represent elegant, but poorly characterized, examples of molecular
      recognition and are potential targets for antiretroviral therapy. The fundamental dimerization
      unit for the Moloney murine sarcoma and leukemia gamma retroviruses (MuLV and MuSV,
      respectively) spans a 170-nt minimal dimerization active sequence (MiDAS). The MiDAS domain
      also contains sequences implicated in specific RNA dimer recognition and packaging. In the
      dimer, two self-complementary (palindromic) sequences, PAL1 and PAL2, form intermolecular
      duplexes and an SL1-SL2 (stem-loop) domain forms loop-loop base iii pairs and extensive
      tertiary interactions. I first develop a framework for assembly of the retroviral RNA dimer,
      by analyzing the thermal stabilities and secondary structures of MiDAS mutants in which PAL1,
      PAL2 heteroduplexes or the SL1-SL2 interactions were successively disrupted. The
      well-conserved SL1-SL2 domain makes the first and most stable contacts in the dimer (10
      kcal/mol), while PAL1 and PAL2 heteroduplexes make much smaller contributions to dimer
      stability (0.5 to 2 kcal/mol). As an important step towards a common retroviral dimerization
      mechanism, I next demonstrate that the monomer and dimer MiDAS structures for two murine
      retroviruses (MuLV and MuSV), while not identical, are similarly organized. I then show that
      the structure of the in vitro-generated dimer robustly reflects the structure of the mature
      dimeric RNA extracted from infectious MuLV virions. In the genomic RNA, I identify a
      long-range interaction between the MiDAS domain and a sequence ~300 nucleotides downstream.
      Finally, I provide an explanation for the ability of a retrovirus to exclusively package only
      genomic RNA dimers. I characterize specific protein binding sites within the MiDAS domain
      directly inside authentic virions and confirm these sites in vitro. Both Gag and nucleocapsid
      interact specifically with the first and last nucleotides in UCUG sequences through precise,
      zinc finger-mediated, contacts. I define a minimal packaging signal for the retroviral RNA
      dimer as a tandem array of UCUG sequences, flanked by stable base-paired regions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation is about the success of African-American students at a specialized,
      residential high school in the Southeastern United States. The following study investigates
      the impact of self-efficacy and social identity on the development of resilience and the
      resulting mathematics success of six African-American students at Caldwell Academy. Using
      phenomenology to convey the academic and social experiences of the participants, the analysis
      uncovers their self-perceived ability to be mathematically successful as well as the academic
      and social strategies contributing that success. Both high levels of self-efficacy and strong
      social support systems have contributed to their ability to be mathematically successful.
      Research states that high-achieving African-American students use a variety of protective
      mechanisms and coping strategies to navigate difficult situations (Floyd, 1996; Lee, 1991;
      Steward, 1996), such as those reported by the participants. The results of this study can be
      used to develop practices for creating residential learning environments sensitive to the
      needs and unique challenges of African-American students, as well as to develop mathematics
      efficacy and strong social identities, both of which contribute significantly to academic
      resilience.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Glycolate aldol reactions and glycolate alkylations, followed by ring-closing
      metatheses, are used to prepare medium ring ethers used as building blocks for polycyclic
      ether containing natural products. Using the glycolate aldol/ring-closing metathesis strategy,
      an approach to a previously unprepared subclass of the C2– C11 cyclized cembranoids known as
      the asbestinins is described. An oxonene is efficiently synthesized and utilized as a manifold
      for an intramolecular Diels–Alder cycloaddition to form a hydroisobenzofuran moiety
      characteristic of the asbestinins. This tricyclic adduct represents the bulk of the framework
      of the asbestinins. Ultimately, the tricycle was progressed to two different natural products,
      11-acetoxy-4-deoxyasbestinin D and asbestinin-12, via a late-stage divergent route. The
      completion of these natural products represented the first instance of preparing an asbestinin
      using chemical synthesis, and served to confirm the absolute configuration of the subclass.
      Additionally, a glycolate alkylation/ring-closing metathesis strategy was used to prepare the
      B ring of brevetoxin A on multigram scale. Novel reactivity was discovered and exploited along
      this route. Namely, it was found that glycolate alkylation adducts can undergo direct Claisen
      condensation or reduction to the aldehyde to provide useful synthons. The B ring has been
      progressed to the BCDE tetracycle in a convergent fashion, and portions of this supply have
      been carried forward to provide possible coupling partners for the GHIJ fragment in hopes of
      completing brevetoxin A in a convergent manner.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The Huascarán Biosphere Reserve (HBR) is a tropical Andean protected area managed for
      “conservation with development,” one that is experiencing the common challenge of achieving
      both. Although there is little question that what was recognized as a global treasure in 1975,
      is a cultural landscape shaped by a long history of human occupation and management, the
      sustainability of indigenous agro-pastoral land use is now in question. My research was
      motivated by a desire to understand the environmental outcomes of indigenous livelihoods in an
      era in which they are being increasingly transformed by the conservation and development
      agendas of national and international actors. I argue that failures of people-centered
      conservation are less to do with failures of local indigenous peoples to sustainably manage
      resources, and more to do with failures of policy-makers to accept responsibility for their
      role in shaping this outcome. Through the lens of cultural and political ecology I show that
      successful biodiversity conservation in the HBR will demand greater attention to the specifics
      of common property management, and to the social, political, economic and environmental
      contexts in which communal institutions and their constituent decision-makers are embedded.
      This multi-scaled perspective takes a critical look at tourism and its influence on the
      herding practices of indigenous agro-pastoral households in the HBR. By drawing on common
      property theory, human behavioral ecology, and ecological fieldwork I show that enclosure in a
      protected area and the unsustainable growth of adventure tourism have had many unintended
      consequences. I discuss these consequences throughout the dissertation as they are revealed
      through analyses of data collected during 2 years of fieldwork, their implications for
      indigenous livelihoods and biodiversity conservation in the HBR, as well as some potential
      solutions for avoiding negative outcomes in this unique protected landscape.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The recent emergence of multicore and related technologies in many commercial systems
      has increased the prevalence of multiprocessor architectures. Contempora-neously, real-time
      applications have become more complex and sophisticated in their behavior and interaction.
      Inevitably, these complex real-time applications will be de-ployed upon these multiprocessor
      platforms and require temporal analysis techniques to verify their correctness. However, most
      prior research in multiprocessor real-time scheduling has addressed the temporal analysis only
      of Liu and Layland task systems. The goal of this dissertation is to extend real-time
      scheduling theory for multiproces-sor systems by developing temporal analysis techniques for
      more general task models such as the sporadic task model, the generalized multiframe task
      model, and the recurring real-time task model. The thesis of this dissertation is: Optimal
      online multiprocessor real-time scheduling algorithms for sporadic and more general task
      systems are impossible; however, efficient, online scheduling algorithms and associated
      feasibility and schedulability tests, with provably bounded deviation from any optimal test,
      exist. To support our thesis, this dissertation develops feasibility and schedulability tests
      for various multiprocessor scheduling paradigms. We consider three classes of mul-tiprocessor
      scheduling based on whether a real-time job may migrate between pro-cessors: full-migration,
      restricted-migration, and partitioned. For all general task systems, we obtain feasibility
      tests for arbitrary real-time instances under the full-and restricted-migration paradigms.
      Despite the existence of tests for feasibility, we show that optimal online scheduling of
      sporadic and more general systems is im-possible. Therefore, we focus on scheduling algorithms
      that have constant-factor approximation ratios in terms of an analysis technique known as
      resource augmenta-tion. We develop schedulability tests for scheduling algorithms,
      earliest-deadline-first (edf) and deadline-monotonic (dm), under full-migration and
      partitioned scheduling paradigms. Feasibility and schedulability tests presented in this
      dissertation use the workload metrics of demand-based load and maximum job density and have
      provably bounded deviation from optimal in terms of resource augmentation. We show the
      demand-based load and maximum job density metrics may be exactly computed in pseudo-polynomial
      time for general task systems and approximated in polynomial time for sporadic task systems.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This work investigates the role that labor market rigidities play in the data series
      implied by dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models of the US economy. This work
      questions and evaluates the increasing reliance by the macroeconomic literature on the
      Calvostyle wage rigidity first introduced by Erceg et al. (2000). The baseline case of Calvo
      wage stickiness is analyzed and compared with the alternative labor market rigidities of
      staggered relative contracting (Fuhrer and Moore 1995a, 1995b), sticky information (Mankiw and
      Reis 2001a, 2002), and search and matching frictions (Trigari 2004). The models are compared
      by their abilities to match the stylized facts and empirical US evidence as characterized by
      the impulse response functions (IRFs) resulting from a structural vector autoregression. The
      focus here is on policy shocks identified with the short-run restrictions of Christiano et al.
      (1999) and technology shocks identified with the long-run restrictions of Shapiro and Watson
      (1988) and Blanchard and Quah (1989). Following the approach of Christiano et al. (2001,
      2005), a subset of the parameters under each specification of the model is estimated by
      minimizing the distance between the empirical and model IRFs. This work extends the current
      literature by nesting these alternative labor market models for the first time in a dynamic,
      nonstationary general equilibrium model that includes technology growth and can allow for a
      permanent increase in the level of productivity. This work offers several conclusions
      involving the role that alternative labor market rigidities play in the data series implied by
      DSGE models of the US economy. First, the sticky information framework analyzed here improves
      on the performance of the flexible wage version of the model when matching impulse responses
      to a monetary policy shock, but cannot improve on the flexible wage version when matching the
      responses to a long-run technology shock. Second, the relative staggered contracting
      specification performs well in matching the empirical responses of a policy shock and a
      technology shock when output considerations are included directly into contract negotiations.
      Third, both the right-to-manage and Nash bargaining specifications lose some of their ability
      to explain labor market behavior and unemployment when extended and nested in a more general,
      standard DSGE model. With the introduction of a procyclical vacancy equation, these search and
      bargaining frameworks are able to offer a potential improvement over alternative frameworks
      through the inclusion of an extensive margin (number of workers) in the labor market. These
      results suggest that the source of the labor market friction has important implications for
      the behavior of aggregate macroeconomic variables and thus for the conduct of monetary policy.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>In this dissertation, we extend the work by Michael Taylor to examine the behavior for
      small times solutions to certain nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations ut = i4u+q(u), u(0) = u0,
      with initial data u(0) = u0, with emphasis on cases where u0 is compactly supported and
      piecewise smooth, with simple caustics on Rn, for n 3. Our goal is to provide a first order
      correction to the solution to the corresponding linear equation, and to estimate the error of
      this approximation.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The current study examined how collective bargaining provisions affected average
      teacher salary trends for states from 1960 to 2000, after controlling for various economic,
      social, and demographic variables. Results show that collective bargaining had a significant,
      but waning, effect on teacher pay increases over the 40 year period with slight effects found
      in the 1970s after the initial organization of unions. Further, results show this effect in
      certain regions, but not others. Finally, results show that after controlling for other
      factors, the difference in teacher pay between collective bargaining and non-collective
      bargaining states has changed little over the last 40 years. Any increases experienced in the
      collective bargaining states were also experienced in the latter, either simultaneously or
      shortly thereafter. This study is the first interstate historical comparison of teacher pay
      that controls for teacher educational attainment and experience over a 40 year period, as well
      as adjusting for inflation and cost of living. The implications for this comprehensive and
      innovative approach calls for a refocusing of research on teacher salaries such that these
      findings combined with other studies of similar rigor and depth will be able to better inform
      educational policy decisions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The gravitational waves produced by the inspiral and merger of two black holes are
      expected to be the first detected by the newly constructed gravitational wave observatories.
      Accurate theoretical models that describe the generation and shape of these gravitational
      waves need to be constructed. These theoretical waveforms will aid in the detection of
      astrophysical wave sources, and will allow us to test general relativity in the strong field
      regime. Numerical relativity is the leading candidate for constructing accurate waveforms, and
      in this thesis we develop methods to help advance the field. In particular we use a corotating
      spherical coordinate system to simulate the evolution of a compact binary system as it
      produces gravitational radiation. We combine this method with both the Weak Radiation Reaction
      and Hydro-without-Hydro approximations to produce stable dynamical evolutions. We also utilize
      Nordstr¨om’s conformally flat theory of gravitation as a relativistic laboratory during the
      development process. Additionally we perform semi-analytic calculations to determine the
      approximate way in which binaries decay in Nordstr¨om’s theory. We find an excellent agreement
      between our semi-analytic calculations and the orbital evolutions produced by the code, and
      thus conclude that these methods form a solid basis for simulating binary inspirals and the
      gravitational waves they produce in general relativity.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Cities and metropolitan regions face several challenges including rising urban
      populations, sprawled land use patterns, and related auto dependence, energy consumption,
      greenhouse emissions, and human health effects. An important aspect of addressing these
      challenges involves understanding the connection between urban environments and spatial and
      temporal characteristics of individual activity-travel behavior. Advances in the research
      arena can inform the development of land use and transportation policies that facilitate
      access to local opportunities, reduce auto dependence, promote healthy travel behavior such as
      walking and bicycling, and generate travel time savings. Further, research efforts on this
      subject can help to measure the successes of existing transportation and land use planning
      tools in terms of their “secondary” effects on individuals’ spatial accessibility, time
      allocation, and quality of life. My dissertation systematically tests the connection between
      land use and activitytravel behavior by presenting three perspectives: one that focuses on the
      census block group level; another that focuses on the individual level; and one that focuses
      on the trip level. The analysis at the census block group level, named as the census block
      group level activity pattern analysis in this research, examines how the built environment of
      a census block-group is associated with the aggregated distribution of activities and trips
      occurring within the census block-group. The individual-level analysis, named as the
      individual activity space and time allocation analysis, links individuals’ spatial and
      temporal footprints to the built environment at the home location, traffic conditions at the
      home location, weather conditions, and individual/household characteristics. The trip-level
      analysis, named as the trip distance and duration analysis, demonstrates how environmental
      factors at the trip origin and destination and activity/trip characteristics are associated
      with the distance and duration of each trip. The census block group level activity pattern
      analysis indicates that dense developments are not necessarily positively associated with
      diversity in activity categories or demographic diversity of the individuals who were involved
      with activities in the area. Greater land use diversity is associated with higher activity
      density and greater activity diversity but lower alternative mode share. Grid street patterns
      and the presence of sidewalks are both associated with higher activity density and more
      alternative mode share. The individual activity space and time allocation analysis shows that
      small activity area size—less spatially dispersed daily activity locations—are related to
      dense developments, more retail stores, the presence of sidewalks, and the presence of heavy
      traffic in the residential neighborhood and are related to cold weather and precipitation.
      Most of the built environment factors show no association with time allocations to out-of-home
      activities or leisure activities, while they do show various associations with travel time
      allocations depending on the travel mode. Besides the built environment at the home location,
      weather conditions and traffic conditions also play an important role in both the individual
      spatial footprint and time allocation The trip distance and duration analysis suggests that
      shorter distance of non-work related trips is related to more retail stores, fewer industrial
      firms, and heavy traffic near the trip origin. After controlling for trip distance, the
      duration of driving trips is positively related to street grids, the presence of sidewalks,
      and dense developments at the trip origin and/or destination while the duration of walking
      trips is not. The analysis also suggests different activity/travel categories show dramatic
      differences in the sensitivity to environmental factors such as the built environment, traffic
      conditions, and weather. Not only do trips with different modes respond to these environmental
      factors in different ways, but trips related to different activity categories also show
      differences in the environmental sensitivity. Walking trips are more vulnerable to weather
      conditions than are driving trips. This research took an activity-based and time use approach
      to study the land usetravel connection, which fills the gap between activity modeling and land
      use-travel modeling in the existing literature. Evidence found in this research supports the
      notion that transportation problems can be ameliorated through the use of land use strategies.
      The research also points out that the strength of the land use-travel connection is
      conditional on other environmental factors such as traffic and weather conditions, as well as
      activity context such as activity type and time of day.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Although much has been written about Pablo Neruda and Jorge Carrera Andrade
      independent of one another, this dissertation is meant to investigate their lives and literary
      careers as two associated realms that, as opposed to being isolated, were intertwined and
      connected. This connectedness reveals itself in their poetry and results in many striking
      similarities in the poets’ literary creation. Furthermore, this dissertation examines the
      personal correspondence that the poets exchanged and therefore the epistolary genre. The
      poets’ personal letters are analyzed as literary texts alongside a discussion of the genre. In
      chapter one, I briefly introduce this study examining the dual meaning of correspondence that
      will be addressed in this dissertation. In the second chapter, I carefully examine the lives
      of Neruda and Carrera Andrade, revealing the shocking similarities that exist among the two
      writers. The third chapter is an examination of the poets’ literary production and the way
      that their common themes manifest themselves in their poems. The fourth chapter is an analysis
      of the personal correspondence of the two poets that I found at the University of New York at
      Stony Brook Special Collections Department. The seven letters that I analyze reveal the
      development of the major themes in the men’s poetry and uncover the poets’ personal
      relationship, proving that in addition iv to having very similar lives and works, the two men
      did influence one another. The letters also serve as literary texts that warrant the
      examination of the critic.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The medieval poetic genre and performance practice of courtly love elaborates the
      delirious enjoyment and exquisite pain of unquenched desire and celebrates its textual
      performance; photography visualizes this highly fraught system of desire. Photography is
      imbued with courtly love because of its relation to desire, distance, and idealization. The
      photograph’s referent appears to be present but is always lost, a paradox which keeps the
      viewer’s desire inflamed; I read the unavailability of the referent, and the desires it
      arouses, in terms of the desires aroused by the beautiful and idealized but unavailable
      courtly lady. What photography gives, what it denies, and the desires it arouses are courtly.
      I adopt courtly love’s nineteenth- and twentieth-century theorizations, particularly the work
      of psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and semiotician Roland Barthes, as a strategy for reading
      photography. Both Barthes and Lacan write of a desire that is idealizing, unrequited, and
      related to the primordial experience of the mother. Lacan specifically addresses courtly love
      as the epitome of the non-rapport between the sexes and the ultimate example of sublimation.
      Lacanian psychoanalysis revolves around the issue of the subject’s desire; he sees courtly
      love as the embodiment of desire in the life of the subject. Lacan’s discussion of the
      sublimation of the courtly lady provides a way to theorize the sublimation operative in
      photography, and the resulting impact on photographic ethics. If subjectivity is based on
      lack/desire, the photograph is the perfect object to operate on both: it always represents
      lack and absence, but simultaneously offers possession, images of wholeness, and illusions of
      closeness. A close comparative reading of Barthes’s Camera Lucida (1980) with his A Lover’s
      Discourse (1977) demonstrates significant affinities between the two and links Barthes’s work
      on photography and desire. The photographs I address include Hiroshi Sugimoto’s Interior
      Theaters, photographs commissioned by painter and poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti of
      Pre-Raphaelite icon Jane Burden Morris, and the recently-identified genre of
      nineteenth-century portraiture of men commemorating their loving friendships.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>“Friends Like These” examines the decision by elements of the Menominee, Dakota,
      Potawatomi, and Ho Chunk tribes to ally with the United States government during the Black
      Hawk War of 1832. Because this conflict is usually depicted as a landgrab by ravenous settlers
      and the war occurred within two years of the passage of the Indian Removal Act, the military
      participation of these tribes seems incongruous. This work seeks to determine why various
      bands of these tribes cooperated with the U.S. Army when such alliance seemed inimical to the
      interests of their respective tribes. Moreover, it explores the extent to which the Americans
      conceived of themselves as allies to the Indians while assessing the consequences of this
      alliance for each of the tribes involved. This study finds that the Indians participated in
      the Black Hawk War to fulfill their own wartime objectives, and that in so doing they sought
      to apply familiar forms to the new situation that unfolded in the years after the War of 1812.
      Seeking to strike traditional tribal enemies, extract political advantage and material gain
      from the Americans, and fulfill important male gender expectations, the Indians generally
      achieved their objectives—but they also helped create conditions that wrought permanent change
      on the world in which they lived.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This thesis consists of two empirical studies concerning the interaction between
      venture financing and the performance of publicly listed firms. Chapter I examines how venture
      capitalists impact the post-issue performance of firms in which they invest. Chapter II
      analyzes the competitive effects of large and new initial public offerings (IPOs) on their
      listed industry competitors, and finds that industry rivals supported by venture capitalists
      gain more competitive advantages. More specifically, Chapter I examines the strategic choice
      of venture capitalists (VCs) as “incubators” versus “short-term investors” and the impact of
      this choice on the performance of firms in which they invest. In particular, I study the
      determinants of the length of the venture capital incubation period and its impact on the IPO
      underpricing and on the post-IPO operating performance. I find that VCs play a dual role as
      “incubators” and as “short-term investors”. As short-term investors, VCs decrease the
      incubation period when the stock market valuations are high. As incubators, VCs increase the
      incubation period of firms perceived to be of high risk. With regard to the effect of the VC
      incubation period, I find that firms with a longer incubation period are less underpriced,
      more likely to survive, and exhibit better operating performance after they go public. The
      results are robust to controlling for the selection bias of firms obtaining venture financing.
      Chapter II analyzes the effect of large Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) on publicly listed
      industry competitors. The chapter provides evidence that companies experience negative short
      term stock price reactions to IPOs in their industry. Furthermore incumbent firms show
      significant deterioration in their operating performance. These results are consistent with
      issuing firms having an IPO related competitive advantage over their competitors. The chapter
      identifies potential reasons for this gain in competitiveness: certification by venture
      capitalist and top-tier investment banks, the loosening of financial constraints, and the
      presence of knowledge capital. Results show that all of these aspects of competitiveness are
      significant in explaining the cross section of underperformance as well as survival
      probabilities for incumbent firms.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>I examine whether earnings that are smoother or more volatile than cash flows provide
      or garble information. Consistent with theories that predict more informed trading when public
      information is less informative, I find that bid-ask spreads and the probability of informed
      trading are higher both when earnings are smoother than cash flows and also when earnings are
      more volatile than cash flows. Additional tests suggest that managers’ discretionary choices
      that lead to smoother or more volatile earnings than cash flows, on average, garble
      information. However, I find that informed trading is attenuated in settings in which theory
      suggests that discretionary smoothing or volatizing of earnings is likely to be informative.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Attempts to justify evidently important parts of morality regularly seem to succeed as
      justifications only by robbing these same parts of their importance. If asked to defend the
      goodness of generosity, for example, one might point to its salutary effects. But to the
      extent that this defense succeeds it seems simultaneously to imply that it is not generosity,
      but rather generating salutary effects, that is valuable. The “defense” of generosity’s value
      has apparently exposed it as “merely derivative”, a phrase that often amounts to a
      philosophical slur. But in this and other cases we might hope to do better. What is needed,
      and what I offer in this dissertation, is a clear articulation of the problem’s structure and
      then, against this background, a specification of the criteria a proposed solution must meet
      in order to be successful. I argue that to solve the problem a kind of normative “transfer”
      must take place between objects of justification and their justifying ground, allowing the
      recipient to attain a kind of normative independence in spite of its obvious justificatory
      dependence. I call this phenomenon “normative inheritance”. If defensible, normative
      inheritance would allow for a proper vindication of rights, rules, virtues, and so on, whose
      normativity is apparently derivative but, hopefully, not merely so.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Lyngbya wollei (Speziale ex Gomont) is a filamentous cyanobacterium that is capable of
      nitrogen fixation. Within Florida springs, L. wollei is an opportunistic invader that can
      smother both native and invasive submerged aquatic vegetation with its thick benthic mats (up
      to 1-1.5 kg dry weight m-2), and it has been shown to produce toxins (neurotoxins and
      hepatotoxins). Blooms of L. wollei persist in many recreational and drinking water supplies
      within the southeastern United States. The inability to find a statistically significant
      relationship between L. wollei biomass in Florida springs and nutrient concentrations
      (nitrogen, phosphorus) has led to the hypothesis that the present standard for identification
      of freshwater L. wollei may in fact encompass multiple species. There is a need to accurately
      identify this cyanobacterium and identify limiting nutrients, the input of which may be
      controlled by water managers in an effort to reduce L. wollei biomass. We sequenced partial
      16S rDNA and nifH genes from L. wollei mats that were identified using the current taxonomic
      description for L. wollei. The 16S and nifH datasets contained diverse sequences. The majority
      of sequences were found to be from L. wollei filaments and unidentified cyanobacteria. Of the
      unidentified cyanobacteria, six 16S sequences corresponded (&gt;98% similarity) to a known
      toxin-producing Phormidium sp. The combined phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rDNA and nifH
      genes, in conjunction with morphological analysis (cell width and length), indicates that the
      current L. wollei description in the literature represents two or possibly three species. No
      correlation was found between the species divisions and dissolved inorganic nitrogen
      concentration and N:P for the collection sites. To determine limiting nutrients for effective
      mitigation of L. wollei biomass in Florida springs, four dissolved inorganic nutrient addition

               <mods:abstract>Phrases such as “bride of Christ” and passages which describe Christ as a
      “Bridegroom,” a “Spouse,” and a “Lover” appear in a wide range of Christian texts composed in
      both Latin and vernacular languages. The phrase has become almost a generic descriptor for
      religious women—especially mystics—yet the function of the relationship between Christ and his
      beloved is never a constant. I explore the language and imagery that surrounds Christ’s many
      brides by examining a selection of medieval works that portray Christ as a desirable spouse
      for Christian women. Relationships between Christ and pious women did not consist exclusively
      of a spiritual re-enactment of courtship and marriage in vision or ritual. Mystics enacted
      marriage to Jesus in visions, while nuns’ vows and profession ceremonies are described as a
      marriage to Christ, a chaste union to be consummated in heaven, traditionally modeled upon
      secular marriage ceremonies. However, the title “Bride of Christ” was not uniformly applied by
      and to medieval women, and some nuns and mystics never gained a bridal association. Most
      importantly, married and lay women could become brides of Christ, even if they were not
      mystics. As the number of Christ’s brides increased in the thirteenth and fourteenth
      centuries, women who claimed this special relationship were less likely to be automatically
      recognized as holy. Consequently, the phrase “bride of Christ” became politically charged, and
      by the fifteenth century, it was used in innovative but cautious ways, especially in writing
      by and for women’s religious communities. My investigation of Christ and his brides between
      the twelfth and sixteenth centuries highlights the brides’ gradual disassociation from
      sanctity. Though twelfth- and thirteenth-century women religious became brides of Christ for
      their chastity and mystical experiences, I argue that the number and nature of brides of
      Christ in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries contributed to growing doubts about women’s
      religious writing and creativity, resulting in the introduction of a new model for female
      sanctity that de-emphasized mystical experience and the bridal relationship in favor of
      virtuous actions.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The effectiveness of television advertising has been most extensively investigated
      with two variables, moods-generated by television programs and the length of commercials.
      However, scant attention has been paid to determining these variables together and
      investigating the interaction between them in influencing advertising effectiveness. This
      study hypothesized that longer ads would be more effective than their shorter counterparts and
      that ads placed in a positive mood program would be more effective than those embedded in a
      negative program. To examine these hypotheses, this study conducted a 2X2 factorial-designed
      experiment. The data for this study were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance
      (ANOVA). This study included two independent variables, commerciallength formats (15-second
      and 30-second) and program-induced moods (positive and negative). The dependent variable was
      advertising effectiveness measured by brand recall, brand recognition, attitude toward ad
      (Aad), and purchase intention (PI). Consistent with previous research, the length of
      commercials was positively associated with advertising effectiveness regardless of
      moods-generated by television programs. In terms of context-induced mood, however, the
      findings were not as significant as that of commercial length. The ANOVA analyses found
      significant mood effects from an individual measure of attitude toward ad where the ad placed
      in the positive television context was found to be more effective than those in the
      negative-mood condition. For other variables, the findings were not significant, and they were
      somewhat contradictory. Similarly, interaction effects were only found in individual ad and
      brand. However, this study failed to detect significant interaction effects in overall
      evaluations. Based on the findings of this study, it can be concluded that commercial length
      effects are more salient in affecting ad performance than effects generated by program
      context. Nonetheless, considering two significant interactions and several near-significant
      interactions, more empirical research should follow to gain a better understanding of the
      effects of context-induced mood and commercial length on television advertising.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Economic literature on international trade identifies the sources of comparative
      advantage like endowments and technology that drive international trade and result in gains
      from trade. Comparative advantage is however also affected by environmental standards.
      Stricter environmental standards are commonly believed to erode an existing comparative
      advantage of developing countries and hence result in lower gains from trade. Based on this
      popular belief, developing economies might legislate weak environmental standards or fail to
      enforce existing standards in the hope of encouraging “dirty” industries. My essays take a
      more sophisticated look at the trade and environment relation and find that the relation
      between welfare gains from trade and environmental quality is not one of simple trade-off of
      one against the other as popularly believed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Despite the enormous success of vaccinations in decreasing disease burden, there are
      still millions of deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases worldwide, especially in the
      developing world. The literature reports that people living in rural areas in China often fail
      to be immunized not only because of inability to pay user fee but also due to poor
      geographical accessibility to vaccination sites. However, the level of user fees and the
      locations of vaccination sites have not been systematically determined in vaccination planning
      practices, and little research effort has been dedicated to develop a scientific tool to
      design optimal vaccination strategies. This dissertation addresses important policy questions
      of how many vaccination sites are needed, where they should be located, and how much users
      should be charged, so as to maximize the outcomes of vaccination programs under budget
      constraints. This research develops a decision-analytic tool to address these policy questions
      based on optimization models integrated with various quantitative techniques. The data were
      collected from a case study conducted in a rural area of southern China in 2004 with
      contingent valuation (CV) surveys to assess households’ willingness to pay for typhoid
      vaccinations and using geographical information systems (GIS) to obtain location and road
      information. The data were used to estimate a household demand function for vaccinations which
      depends on user travel distance as well as the user fee. Using the demand information in
      location models and simulations, this research demonstrates how the outcomes of vaccination
      programs change based upon the outpost locations and user fees, along with evidence of
      substantial private benefits brought about by locating outposts closer to users. It also
      estimates a cost function to show how much of the costs of delivering vaccinations are
      associated with the number of outposts and the range of vaccination coverage. All these
      results are integrated into an optimization tool to seek out the user fee and locations of
      vaccination outposts that meets specific policy objectives. Upon successful adoption and
      implementation in actual planning processes, this tool could play a critical role in
      determining user fees and locations for market-based public health vaccination services in
      developing countries.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Monolayer films of liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) are modeled with a two
      dimensional (2D) analog of the Doi-Hess (1981, 1976) kinetic model. In this dissertation, we
      focus on the analysis of the Doi-Hess Smoluchowski equation for the orientational distribution
      of LCPs, and an understanding of the distinctions which arise due to 2D confinement relative
      to results for full orientational space distributions. In Chapter 2, we study the mesoscopic
      model which approximates the Doi-Hess kinetic model, based on a second-moment closure. In this
      setting, we establish a more complete solution to the classical problem of how orientational
      degeneracy of quiescent nematic equilibria breaks in weak shear, and we determine the
      distinctions between two versus three dimensional sheared nematic-liquids. We give the first
      proof that limit cycles, known as tumbling orbits, must arise beyond the parameter boundary
      for the steady-unsteady transition. Finally, we show the shear-perturbed 2D phase diagram is
      significantly more robust to closure approximations than the 3D system. In Chapter 3, we solve
      a two dimensional Smoluchowski equation which is the extended Doi-Hess model for magnetic
      nano-rod dispersions in linear flows. We obtain closed-form representations of all steady
      state so-lutions in terms of Boltzmann distributions of the Smoluchowski equation. This method
      yields an exact, finite-dimensional reduction of the infinite-dimensional PDE, from which we
      construct bifurcation diagrams for all equilibria without external fields.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>With youth smoking rates showing little decline since the late 1990’s, the state of
      North Carolina implemented a multi-component initiative focused on teenage tobacco use
      prevention and cessation. One component of this initiative is Tobacco.Reality.Unfiltered., or
      TRU, an anti-tobacco media campaign, aimed at North Carolina youth ages 11 – 17 years. The
      primary goal of this campaign is to prevent the initiation of tobacco use, especially
      cigarette smoking, among youth. This research evaluates the progress that the TRU campaign has
      made in achieving its short term, i.e. campaign awareness and receptivity, and long term, i.e.
      prevention of tobacco use, goals using a longitudinal telephone survey of North Carolina youth
      (N = 502). The results indicate that 45% of North Carolina youth had confirmed awareness of at
      least one TRU ad, with the majority of youth reporting that the ads were convincing,
      attention-grabbing, and gave good reasons not to smoke. Latent transition analyses indicate
      that the probabilities at which youth were transitioning into smoking experimentation were not
      different for youth who were aware of the TRU campaign versus youth who were unaware of the
      campaign. These results held regardless of whether smoking initiation was measured using a
      youth’s lifetime smoking behavior or current smoking behavior. A difference did emerge in the
      transition probabilities for younger and older youth regarding current smoking behavior, with
      older youth transitioning into smoking experimentation at a higher rate than younger youth.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation examines the effect of skewness on expected returns posited by prior
      theoretical work. The dissertation shows that the low returns of stocks with high volatility
      and of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) are the result of a preference for skewness. First, I
      analyze the relation between expected returns of stocks and their idiosyncratic volatility. I
      confirm that stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility have low subsequent returns. There is
      also substantial time-series co-variation between stocks with high idiosyncratic risk. An
      alternative measure of aggregate skewness, the cross-sectional skewness of all firms at a
      given point in time, helps explain both the common timevariation and the premium associated
      with firms with high idiosyncratic volatility. The next section extends the analysis of
      cross-sectional skewness to IPOs. In event time tests, IPOs only underperform if they list in
      times of high cross-sectional skewness. In calendar time tests, the returns of IPOs are
      sensitive to cross-sectional skewness after controls for size and book to market. The final
      section shows that proxies for technological change, such as lagged patent grant growth,
      predict future cross-sectional skewness. This suggests an economic interpretation of
      cross-sectional skewness as the result of changes in industry structure brought about by
      shocks such as significant technological change.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The regional interests of third party interveners are critical determinants of
      intervention in civil war. Foreign policymakers often tout the importance of regional
      stability when justifying their intervention decisions, as civil wars have shown a distinct
      tendency to be geographically contagious. Third parties observe these regional diffusion
      properties and consider a war's likelihood of infecting its regional context when deciding
      whether or not to become involved. As a third party becomes increasingly able to contain a
      civil war's hostilities from spreading into a region of foreign policy value to the potential
      intervener, intervention to contain the conflict becomes increasingly likely. I draw on
      theories of war diffusion and intervention to construct a model of intervention decision
      making, focusing on third party interests in the containment of conflict hostilities.
      Hypotheses derived from this model are then tested on the population of potential interveners
      for all civil wars in the post{World War II period. The empirical results support the
      theoretical arguments put forth in the intervention model, as third parties are shown to
      intervene in confiicts that threaten the third party's regional stability interests. In
      addition, the relative effectiveness of intervention as a tool for containing civil war
      hostilities is empirically tested. The findings indicate that interventions increase the
      likelihood of regional contagion in the short{term, but decrease its likelihood in the
      longterm. The theoretical and empirical advances of this dissertation represent the first
      study to directly address how the contagious properties of civil conflicts affect intervention
      phenomena.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Applying concepts from both critical theory and progressive education, this
      dissertation is a study in curriculum theory. Employing the encompassing metaphor of education
      as travel, this project describes the dispositions of orientation, disorientation, and
      misorientation as it investigates pedagogical practices that develop skills necessary for
      students to navigate their future travels as adults. As such, this describes a spatial
      curriculum theory that is situated in place and in the everyday lives of students. It
      investigates various ways students can come to know places, curriculum, and each other through
      dialogic inquiry. Though the value of “getting lost” or disoriented is explored, this
      dissertation is nonetheless largely concerned with how the high school curriculum is preparing
      students for their future travels as adults (their ability to map and navigate their
      environments), as well as instilling in them cooperative habits of journeying. All of which
      runs counter to current test-centered education that misorients students according to an
      economically competitiveness and material individualism. Critical constellations relate to the
      students’ exercises in cognitive mapping both their geographic surroundings as well as
      curricular landscapes. Such constellations also involve a historical understanding of the
      present as well as politicizing curriculum so that students are addressing issues of power,
      oppression, social and environmental justice. Finally, it argues for arts integration and
      particularly performance theory as a means of transformative education and cooperative
      learning.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The cellular response to DNA damage is crucial for cell survival and genome
      maintenance. An accumulation of damage can lead to disease and cancer. Multiple pathways
      mediate the response to both exogenous damage, such as radiation, and endogenous damage that
      occurs during replication and DNA metabolism. These pathways include repair of the lesion,
      cell cycle regulation, and programmed-cell death. The orchestration of these seemingly
      distinct pathways is necessary to ensure accurate and efficient response to DNA damage. In
      this dissertation, I addressed several questions regarding multiple components of the response
      to DNA damage in Drosophila melanogaster. These components include homologs of Blm (DmBlm), a
      RecQ helicase, and ATR (DmATR), a kinase required for the DNA damage checkpoint. Previous work
      demonstrated that DmBlm is required for homologous recombination repair of a DSB, and in the
      absence of DmBlm, repair is often associated with flanking deletions. Work presented here
      shows that these deletions are large and occur after strand-invasion, thereby genetically
      placing DmBlm at a specific step of homologous recombination repair. Studies presented in the
      remainder of this dissertation focus on DmATR, which is required for the DNA damage
      checkpoint. I show that DmATR mutants are defective in the later steps of homologous
      recombination repair of a DSB, but have no defects in end-joining repair. Using mutants of
      downstream components of the checkpoint response, I also demonstrate that loss of the
      checkpoint function in DmATR mutants accounts for most, but not all of the defects reported.
      Furthermore, I analyzed the role of DmATR in response to endogenous damage that results from
      reducing Polá, a polymerase required for DNA synthesis. In the absence of DmATR, reductions in
      Polá result in developmental defects, P53-dependent cell death, and genome instability. This
      work implies that there is a function of DmATR that responds to endogenous damage that is
      independent of its checkpoint response. Both studies of DmATR suggest an intricate interaction
      of multiple DNA damage response pathways to ensure accurate repair, cell survival, proper
      development, and maintenance of genome stability.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>This dissertation consists of three parts regarding High Dimensional Low Sample Size
      (HDLSS) data analysis. Dimension reduction techniques in high dimensional space, based on a
      small number of direction vectors, will be the common theme. In the first part of the
      dissertation, Continuum Regression, originally proposed by Stone and Brooks (1990), will be
      understood as a family of methods for searching among direction vectors. Continuum Regression
      includes three popular methods- Ordinary Least Squares, Partial Least Squares, and Principal
      Component Regression - as special cases. The novel use of Continuum Regression in HDLSS
      settings will be illustrated by an application to microarray experiments. In the second part
      of the dissertation, we will extend the Continuum Regression idea to the challenging case of
      paired HDLSS data. The extended method, Continuum Canonical Correlation, is proposed, as a
      family of methods for searching direction vectors over two high dimensional spaces
      simultaneously. The last part of the dissertation studies the HDLSS asymptotic behavior of the
      maximum covariance direction vectors over two data spaces, i.e., the singular vectors of the
      sample cross-covariance matrix. We find some conditions under which consistency and strong
      inconsistency of the singular vectors in HDLSS is observed.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>With the pressures of the dawning Cold War, postwar Americans struggled to find a
      balance between conformity and authentic individualism. Although musical motion pictures
      appeared conservative, seemingly touting traditional gender roles and championing American
      democratic values, song-and-dance numbers (spectacles) actually functioned as sites of release
      for filmmakers, actors, and moviegoers. Spectacles, which film censors and red-baiting
      politicians considered little more than harmless entertainment and indirect forms of
      expression, were the least regulated aspects of musicals. These scenes provided relatively
      safe spaces for actors to play with and defy, but also reify, social expectations. Spectacles
      were also sites of resistance for performers, who relied on their voices and bodies—sometimes
      at odds with each other—to reclaim power that was denied them either by social strictures or
      an oppressive studio system. Dancing Dreams is a series of case studies about the role of
      spectacle—literal dances but also spectacles of discourse, nostalgia, stardom, and race—in
      inspiring Americans to find forms of individual self-expression with the potential to
      challenge prevailing norms. It explores how Gene Kelly tried to broaden definitions of dance
      and art to make a case for the heterosexual male dancer; how Judy Garland used her
      performances to strike back at studio executives who tried to mold her femininity; how racial
      stereotypes and the Hollywood politics of race limited Oscar Hammerstein’s liberal messages of
      racial inclusion and cooperation; and how fantasy dances could remold nationality and gender.
      Musical motion pictures thus expand the definition of rebellion to include the sort of
      private, and often, quiet forms of personal resistance that occurred throughout the 1950s, and
      helps us to understand better the radical potential of postwar America.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>The nature in which an early educational intervention, the affective quality of the
      early childhood home, and the early adolescent home environment influence mental health
      outcomes in early adolescence was examined using an experimental, longitudinal design. All
      participants were enrolled as infants in a randomized trial of early educational intervention.
      The study sample consists predominately of African-American individuals born into lowincome,
      high-risk families. Within the present study treatment groups were not found to differ
      significantly from one another on overall levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms.
      Post-Hoc analyses revealed that a significantly greater number of individuals in the control
      group experienced symptoms of externalizing psychiatric disorders falling in the borderline
      and clinically significant range. Treatment was not found to significantly moderate the
      influence of the early home environment on early adolescent mental health outcomes, nor was
      the early home environment found to significantly moderate the impact of the early adolescent
      home on early adolescent mental health outcomes. Previous research and theoretical evidence
      suggest that high-quality early educational child care programs may benefit children’s
      socioemotional outcomes. However, few early educational programs have examined direct
      indicators of mental health (i.e., internalizing, externalizing symptoms). Additional research
      is needed to determine whether early educational child care programs are associated with
      mental health benefits that persist into early adolescence.</mods:abstract>

               <mods:abstract>Microarray technologies have gained tremendous interest from researchers in recent
      years. The problem we are interested in is how to combine two microarray data, which have
      systematic batch differences. The reason for the combination is that the combined data set
      contains more samples which will give improved statistical power. This dissertation covers two
      topics about microarray batch adjustment. The first topic is about the visualization of paired
      High Dimension Low Sample Size (HDLSS) data. We propose two interesting directions: the
      Canonical Parallel and the Canonical Orthogonal Directions (CPD &amp; COD). This pair of
      directions gives an insightful 2-d parallel view for understanding paired HDLSS data sets. The
      CPD can be used for adjusting the batch differences. An application to the NCI60 cell lines
      data shows good performance of this method. The second topic is about the comparison between
      three commonly used batch adjustment methods: the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the Distance
      Weighted Discrimination (DWD), and the Prediction Analysis of Microarray (PAM). We show that
      SVM has some serious problems for the HDLSS data. The DWD method is much more robust than PAM
      under the Unbalanced Subgroup Model. The mathematical studies made in this dissertation are in
      the area of HDLSS asymptotics, in the sense that the sample sizes are fixed and the dimension
      (the number of genes) goes to infinity. Hall et. al (2004) have studied the geometric
      structure of the data when the dimension is high. In this dissertation, we study the geometric
      structure of the data under more complicated models. In the first topic, we give the
      conditions for the consistency and the strong inconsistency of the CPD under the Linear Shift
      Model. This model reflects the effects of systematic biases and the random measurement errors.
      In the second topic, we compare the PAM and the DWD method using the Unbalanced Subgroup
      Model. Both methods are biased when the dimension goes to infinity. However, DWD is shown to
      be consistently more robust than PAM. We give the quantitative bias of them. Keywords:

               <mods:abstract>We present 21 cm and optical wavelength observations of 54 galaxies in the Pegasus I
      Cluster. The 21 cm observations include single dish HI measurements, obtained with the Arecibo
      telescope for all 54 galaxies in the sample, as well as HI images, obtained with the VLA for
      10 of these. The optical wavelength observations include broadband B and R, as well as
      narrowband H imaging, obtained with the SOAR telescope for 8 of these galaxies, and B-band,
      I-band, and H imaging of 2 of these, obtained with the MDM telescope. The Arecibo profiles
      reveal an overall HI deficiency in the cluster, with 40% of the galaxies in the core of the
      cluster showing modest deficiencies of typically a factor of 2 C 3. The HI morphology of some
      galaxies shows that the HI disk is smaller than the optical disk and slightly offset from the
      stars. We find a correlation between HI deficiency and the ratio of the HI disk size to
      optical disk size, with the more HI deficient galaxies having relatively smaller HI disks. The
      H imaging indicates the HI deficient galaxies have reduced star formation rates (SFR) and
      smaller H disks, with normal stellar disks. These configurations are usually attributed to an
      interaction between the interstellar medium (ISM) of the galaxy and the hot intracluster
      medium (ICM). Such a result is surprising since the Pegasus Cluster has a low level of X-ray
      emission, and a low velocity dispersion. The low velocity dispersion, coupled with the lack of
      a dense hot ICM indicate that ram pressure stripping should not play a significant role in
      this environment. In addition, two of the galaxies, NGC7604 and NGC7648, are morphologically
      peculiar. Their peculiarities indicate contradictory scenarios of what is triggering their
      unusual star formation. H imaging, along with long-slit spectroscopy of NGC7648 reveal
      morphological features which point to a recent tidal interaction. On the other hand, H imaging
      of NGC7604 reveals a strong episode of star formation concentrated into an asymmetric arc,
      preferentially located on one side of the galaxy. VLA HI mapping shows the HI also highly
      concentrated into that region, suggestive of a ram pressure event. Our data indicate that
      ISM-ICM interactions may play a role in a wider variety of environments than suggested by
      simple ram pressure arguments.</mods:abstract>
